## Over Fifteen-Year Performance Of The Borden Iron Wall 

By Tamra J. Reynolds, M.Sc. Candidate, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario 

The first field demonstration of a granular iron permeable reactive barrier (PRB) was installed in 1991 at CFB Borden, Ontario, downgradient from a source of dissolved PCE and TCE. The iron wall consists of 22% non-commercial granular iron by weight mixed with 78% coarse sand, and has dimensions 5.5 x 1.6 x 2.2 m (l x w x h). The performance of the wall was evaluated throughout 5 years of operation (O'Hannesin, 1993; O'Hannesin and Gillham, 1998). Though the source of PCE and TCE was removed in 1998, the wall remains in place. Now, ten years after the initial installation, further tests are in progress to evaluate the in situ reactivity of the iron. In the current work, an In Situ Microcosm (ISM) technique (Gillham et al., 1990) is being used to determine half lives for TCE, which are then compared with those measured previously. The ISM is a stainless steel cylinder that isolates about 5 L of the iron/sand wall and contains valves and tubing to allow amendment and sampling of groundwater from the ground surface with only minimal disturbance of the in situ material. 


The initial field study gave a TCE half life of 117 hours, assuming the kinetics of degradation to be pseudo-first order. After 5 years, the TCE half life was found to be 142 hours, while the current study, using the results from ISMs installed in the iron/sand wall, gave an average TCE half life of 139 hours. Considering the uncertainty typical of field data, the TCE half lives are remarkably similar. Core material was also collected from various locations across the iron wall and used in laboratory columns. The columns were maintained at 10°C to simulate field conditions, and Borden groundwater, amended with 10 mg/L TCE, was pumped through the columns at a velocity of approximately 20 cm/day. The nine columns indicated an average TCE half life of 20 hours compared to 8 hours in the control column consisting of 22% original iron source and 78% coarse sand. These results are similar to the control column results reported in O'Hannesin, 1993 (19.7 hour TCE half life for a column flow velocity of 32 cm/day) and O'Hannesin and Gillham, 1998 (55 hour TCE half life for a column flow velocity of 8.9 cm/day). The results of the field and laboratory 

### experiments provide evidence of consistent performance of the iron over the past 1 5 years. 

Although the results of the present study are preliminary and site specific, they provide promising evidence regarding the long term performance of permeable reactive barriers.

Construction of the First Research PRB at Borden, ON 


 Are PRBs meeting regulatory objectives; an evaluation of 52 full-scale applications 

 Evaluation by ETI, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada 

- most PRB applications are meeting regulatory objectives; 

- system hydraulics and unexpected concentration levels are the main cause of inadequate     performance; 

- ongoing refinement/improvement of construction methods is minimizing adverse impacts     due to construction.
