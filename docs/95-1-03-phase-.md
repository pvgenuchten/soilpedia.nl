#### CHAPTER 1 

### INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION 

In the scope of the NOBIS-project "Risk reduction, Environmental merit and Costs" (abbreviation REC, Dutch abbreviation RMK) the separate elements have been worked out in phase 1. This document serves as an discussion paper for this phase of the project. The report and the discussion in the workshop form the basis for the aim and activities in phase 2 of the project. In this first, introductory chapter, the scope of this NOBIS-project, as well as the aims and ambitions are described. 

1.1 Why the REC-project?Why the REC-project? 

The assessment of (innovative) remediation concepts, strategies and techniques in the Netherlands is still largely based on a comparison of the expected end results in terms of final concentrations in soil and groundwater. There is however a growing awareness that it is necessary to optimize the efficiency of remediation alternatives from an integral viewpoint, taking into account risk reduction, environmental merit and costs as a function of time. This process of optimization can only be done, when an objective assessment procedure is available, which weighs alternative remediation options on these criteria. Such a procedure should also provide a tool to evaluate ongoing and already completed remediations, and can stimulate future development of new strategies and concepts. A lot of work has been done on the separate topics, however an integrated method is not yet available. 

1.2 The REC-project within NOBISThe REC-project within NOBIS 

The objective of NOBIS is to develop, evaluate and demonstrate innovative strategies, methods, and techniques which will effectively help to control in-situ remediation by means of biotechnology (biorestoration). With a large scale application of the attained results a significant reduction in the costs of the soil clean-up operation will have to be achieved, taking sufficient risk reduction and environmental merit into account. A threatening stagnation in the solution of the soil clean-up problem can thus be counteracted. Therefore, for the selection of NOBIS projects, a tool is needed to evaluate projects with respect to risk reduction, environmental consequences and costs. A project proposal, referred to as REC (Risk reduction, Environmental merit and Costs), was submitted to NOBIS in 1995, and the project started with a NOBIS contribution in january 1996. 

1.3 AmbitionAmbition 

The aim of this REC-project is to develop an objective and quantitative assessment procedure with which the efficiency of remediation alternatives can be judged and optimized from an integral viewpoint, taking into account the elements Risk reduction, Environmental merit and Costs as a function of time. 

The project will be executed in 2 phases. The current, first phase consists of 4 steps: 

Step 1. Problem identification and definition of criteria Step 2. First elaboration of criteria Step 3. First testing of method, using a simple case Step 4. Workshop in June 1996 with experts and users of the method (see Annexe E) 

Based on the outcome of the discussions during the workshop and the level of acceptance by the users, the method will be further elaborated and tested during phase 2 of the project. This will result in an applicable REC-method, with clear instructions for use. 

1.4 What is REC?What is REC? 

REC is the name for a decision support method to assess Risk reduction, Environmental merit and Costs. 

RiskRisk in this context is defined as health effects for human beings and adverse effects on ecosystems and infrastructure, as a result of exposure to soil contamination and as a result of the remedial activities itself. 


EnEnvironmentalvironmental meritmerit is defined as the result of an integral assessment of environmental consequences of a remedial activity and the resulting new situation, compared to the environmental consequences of the situation before remediation. 

CostsCosts include the direct and indirect financial consequences of the contamination and remediation. 

With the REC-method, the remedial options can be evaluated relative to each other or by itself. The RECmethod doesn't take all the criteria in a decision making process into account. It provides for information only on the three defined criteria. Additional criteria can concern for example psychological, legal, political and social factors. 

1.5 How can the REC-method be applied?How can the REC-method be applied? 

The REC-method serves three main purposes: 

1. Generation of innovative remedial strategies, concepts and techniques     Within NOBIS, the value of new developments in in situ soil remediation (a technology,     concept or strategy) can be assessed in terms of efficiency: does this new development lead     to cost reduction, combined with sufficient risk reduction and a positive contribution to the     environment? New developments can be compared to the existing alternatives. 

2. Comparison and optimization of remedial options     For the selection of a remedial option for a specific site, REC can be used to compare several     remedial options, for example excavation combined with groundwater remediation, in situ     bioremediation and isolation, containment and control. Also intensive in-situ bioremediation options     can be compared to extensive ones.     When a specific remedial option is considered, the REC-methodology provides for information, for     example in a checklist with relevant parameters, about the direction for further improvement of this     option with respect to cost reduction, risk reduction and environmental merit. 

3. Evaluation of ongoing and already completed remediation projects     By using the REC-method to evaluate ongoing and already executed projects, a systematic     evaluation of experiences (in situ and otherwise) can be achieved. 

These three main purposes are visualized in figure 1.1. The level of detail required for each purpose is also indicated. The necessary level of detail ranges from low detail, in case of generation of new remedial options, towards high detail when evaluating ongoing and executed remediation projects. 


Fig. 1.1. Chronological order of the applications of the REC-model. 

The proposed REC-method will be similar for each purpose but the number of aspects to be evaluated, and the depth of information required will vary in these stages. For each purpose a relevant set of aspects is selected for each of the three criteria, Risk reduction, Environmental merit and Costs. Considerations for the selection of relevant aspects to cover the most significant influences on the REC-criteria are: 

- transparency; 

- ease of use and simplicity; 

- measurability; 

- discriminating power; 

- relevancy 

- support by experts and users. 

At this stage of the project, the selection of relevant aspects is made for the application of the RECmethod as a tool for comparison of remediation alternatives (purpose number 2). In the next phase the REC-method will be extended to other purposes mentioned. 

1.6 Guide to the readerGuide to the reader 

This report of phase 1 of the REC-project serves as a discussion paper for the workshop on 21 June, 

1996. In chapter 2, general aspects of the method, such as scale and time, and the relation between the criteria will be discussed. In the chapters 3 to 5, the separate criteria Risk reduction, Environmental merit and Costs will be worked out in detail. Every chapter starts with a summary, followed by an elaboration on definition and context of the criterium. Then the selection and operationalization of the relevant aspects for the criterium is discussed. Finally, the quantification of the separate aspects, and how to integrate these aspects into one integrated score for respectively risk reduction, environmental merit and costs is described. In chapter 6, simple examples will be used to illustrate the proposed method. Chapter 7 contains flow charts that describe the actions for application of the REC-method in general terms. 



#### HOOFDSTUK 2 

### GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE REC-METHODGENERAL ASPECTS OF THE REC-METHOD 

Before we elaborate on the general expressions of Risk reduction, Environmental merit and Costs, it is important to remind the reader of the scope of the development of the REC-method in this stage. The proposed REC-method aims at comparing and optimizing remedial options. It is assumed that all the options that are selected for the comparison can be executed in practise. This implies that all the options are within the boundary conditions of legislation, licenses and technical feasibility (i.e. not exceeding unacceptable risk levels, not exceeding unacceptable emission levels, etc.). 

2.1 General expressions of R, E, and CGeneral expressions of R, E, and C 

In defining Risk reduction, Environmental merit and total Costs, it is necessary to define the building blocks for these criteria. For an extensive elaboration of the definition and context of the criteria, we refer to the chapters 3, 4 and 5. 

2.1.1 Risk reduction 

The building block for Risk reduction is RiskRisk , which refers to the adverse effects, that humans, the ecosystem, and infrastructure can suffer from exposure to soil pollutants. Risk will be expressed as a normalized 'total exposure' during a certain time frame. 

### RiskRisk : R = Xi A t (1) 

in which: R is Risk; X is normalized 'total exposure'; i is remediation alternative i; t is time. 

TotalTotal RiskRisk is defined as the sum of Risk before, during and after remediation, all as a function of time, per object. 

 Total RiskTotal Risk : TR = Rbefore + Rduring + Rafter (for a specific time frame, per object) 

 tbefore tduring tafter 

### TRi = Xi, before A -----+ Xi, during A ------+ Xi, after A -----(2) 

 ttotal ttotal ttotal 

in which: before is before remediation starts; during is during remediation; after is after remediation is completed. 


Finally, RiskRisk reductionreduction refers to the impact of the remediation alternative on the total risk of a soil contamination for all objects. This means that to calculate this risk reduction, the total risk that would exist without remediation serves as a reference for the total risk for a specific remediation alternative. This total risk is referred to as TR 0 (Total risk, without remediation). Then the final expression of risk reduction will be: 

 Risk reductionRisk reductionii = TR 0 TRi (3) 

A driving force of remediation is to optimize Risk reduction, relative to its functional use. 

2.1.2 Environmental merit 

The building blocks for Environmental merit are Environmental influencesEnvironmentalinfluences , which refers to the (potential) consequences of the remediation alternative related to the use of scarce commodities and the impact on environmental quality. Environmental influences can be expressed as a normalized 'quality-impact and use of scarce commodities' during a certain time frame. Environmental influences may be regarded as positive (i.e. improvement of soil and groundwater quality) and negative (i.e. emissions to water and air). 

### Environmental influencesEnvironmental influences : EI = (Q + U)i A t (4) 

in which: EI is Environmental Influences; Q + U is normalized 'quality-impact and use of scarce commodities'; i is remediation alternative i; t is time. 

TotalTotal EnvironmentalEnvironmental influenceinfluence is defined per aspect as the sum of Environmental influences before, during and after remediation, all as a function of time. During the process of determining the building blocks of environmental merit, we separate the scores on positive and negative environmental influences. The combination and integration of these influences takes place in the final calculation of environmental merit. Total Environmental influence also separates scores on the regarded quality and scarcity aspects. 

 Total EITotal EI : TEI = EIbefore + EIduring + EIafter (for a specific time frame) 

 tbefore tduring tafter 

### TEIi = (Q + U)i, before A -----+ (Q + U)i, during A -----+ (Q + U)i, after A -----(5) 

 ttotal ttotal ttotal 

in which: before is before remediation starts; during is during remediation; after is after remediation is completed. 

Finally, EnvironmentalEnvironmental meritmerit refers to the integrated score of environmental influences, where the negative environmental influences are subtracted from the positive influences. 

 Environmental meritEnvironmental merit = TEIi, positive aspects TEIi, negative aspects (6) 

A driving force for selection of remediation alternatives is optimizing environmental merit. 


2.1.2 Costs 

This section is a first proposal for the Cost-criterium. This has not yet been discussed extensively within the consortium. Consequently, changes are to be expected. 

The building blocks for the Cost criterium are the Financial expensesFinancialexpenses directly or indirectly related to the remedial action. Besides this, CChangeshanges inin thethe valuevalue ofof assetsassets will be considered as costs. Both aspects will be expressed in monetary terms and need not to be normalized. 

### Financial expensesFinancial expenses : F = (cash flow)i A t (7a) 

### Change in valueChange in value : V = (asset increase or decrease)i A t (7b) 

in which: F is Financial expenses; V is change in Value; cash flow is amount of money paid for investments and operating costs; asset increase or decrease is change in value of asset by remediation; i is remediation alternative i. t is time. 

TotalTotal FiFinancial expenses and change in valuenancial expenses and change in value is defined as the sum of Financial expenses and changes in value before, during and after remediation, all as a function of time. 

 Total F&VTotal F&V : TF&V = F&Vbefore + F&Vduring + F&Vafter (for a specific time frame) 

 tbefore tduring tafter 

### TF&Vi = F&Vi, before A -----+ F&Vi, during A -----+ F&Vi, after A -----(8) 

 ttotal ttotal ttotal 

in which: before is before remediation starts; during is during remediation; after is after remediation is completed. 

Finally, CostsCosts refers to the sum of expenses and changes in value, whereby, the change in the value of assets will (in most cases) be positive (i.e. a negative cost factor!). 

 CostsCosts = TFi(positive sign) + TVi(negative sign) (9) 

A driving force for optimizing remediation alternatives is minimizing costs by minimizing the financial expenses and maximizing the increase of value of assets. 

2.2 Scale of assessment of criteria 

A second aspect that needs to be clarified in this chapter is the relation between the criteria Risk reduction and Environmental merit. Both criteria aim at relating the impact of soil contamination and the remedial activities to improvements for humans and the environment. However, for the purpose of the REC-method, the following distinction is made between the focus of the two criteria: 

Risks can only be assessed if specific objects are defined: in the scope of soil remediation objects on or in the immediate surroundings of the site will be regarded in the object-path-source oriented risk assessment. This means that the scale on which risk reduction is determined is limited to the area of influence of the contaminated site to be regarded. Risk reduction is evaluated at the fifth level (end point) of the general cause-effect chain that is represented in figure 2.1. Environmental merit will be assessed by evaluating the influences of the contamination and its remediation on the use of scarce commodities and the potential impact on environmental quality that 


(^1) In the operationalization of Environmental merit it appears to be necessary to take site specific factors into account for the quantification. However, the evaluation of environmental influences will be independent from the site.

# and vegetation 

has no direct relation to the contaminated site. In fact, environmental merit is based on an evaluation at the third level in the general cause-effect chain.^1 

Fig. 2.1. General cause-effect chain. 

Since risk reduction as well as environmental merit are both based on the cause-effect chain, it can be expected that these criteria are not independent. However, in the development of REC, we aim at preventing double-counting of aspects. Another result of assessing environmental merit at the third level is that the scale on which environmental merit is regarded is not limited or related to the site. The difference in scales for risk reduction and environmental merit is illustrated in figure 2.2. 

Fig. 2.2. Scale difference between Risk reduction and Environmental merit. 


2.3 Time: discountingTime: discounting 

As can be seen in the general expressions in paragraph 2.1., Risk reduction, Environmental merit and Costs are all functions of time. In the comparison of remediation alternatives (the focus of phase 1), alternatives with different total time and timing will be compared. Questions that need to be answered are: 

- How do we compare alternatives that both arrive at the same exposure-risk at the end, but differ     significantly in the remediation time necessary to achieve this (comparing intensive and extensive     remediation)? 

- How do we compare short term higher exposure with long term lower exposure? 

- How do we compare alternatives that both extract the same amount of clean groundwater, but in a     different time frame? 

- How do we compare alternatives that have the same total costs, but differ significantly in the way     these costs are spread in time? 

These questions all refer to the theory of discounting. 

2.3.1 Discounting costs 

It is accepted in daily practise of soil remediation that the costs (restricted to financial expenses) for different remedial alternatives are discounted, before the cost-comparison takes place. The ministry of VROM has defined a simplified method to calculate the Nett Present Value, and establishes every year the discount rate (being the difference between interest and inflation). 

Discounting takes into account the time-value of money: it can be interpreted as the total amount of money that must be reserved in year 0 to provide for all the financial expenses from year 0 to the end of the remediation. The total amount reserved must be invested (i.e. put in the bank) for the established interest rate, and specific prices are supposed to have the same inflation rate as was selected in the calculation. 

One of the most important effects of discounting is that expenses in the long run (dependent on the interest and inflation rate approx. 15 20 years) do not contribute any more to the Nett Present Value. Two alternatives that have the same cash-flow profile and take 20 respectively 40 years will therefore be regarded as having the same Costs. 

Discounting can also be applied to the changes in asset value: the increase or decrease of value can be regarded as a cash inflow or cash outflow (for example if the mortgage is directly related to the value of the property). 

The economic theory on discounting can be applied in the REC-method to make the financial expenses as well as the changes in asset value of different alternatives comparable. 

It is proposed to use discounted costs in the REC-method. 

2.3.2 Discounting risks 

To answer the question whether or not risks must be discounted too, we will look for rationales behind the time-value of risks. Some simple examples will be used to discuss this topic. A distinction must be made between the toxicological and psychological answer. 


Example 1Example 1 From a toxicological point of view, it is not possible to discriminate between the following two situations: 

A is exposed at a certain level A 1 from year 1 to 10. B is exposed at the same level A 1 from year 11 to 20, 

assuming that A and B are at the same age, when the exposure takes place. However, from a psychological point of view, it is likely to expect that A perceives the situation more seriously (higher risk) than B in year 0. 

Example 2Example 2 A second situation in which it is not possible to discriminate on toxicological grounds is the following: 

The exposure of humans and the ecosystem on a specific site are assessed at H 1 and E 1 respectively. Two remedial options are considered: 

A1 Start with (intensive) in situ remediation in year 0; arrive at final situation in year 5, exposure at final situation is 0.75 H 1 and 0.75 E 1. A2 Start with (extensive) in situ remediation in year 5; arrive at final situation in year 15, exposure at final situation is 0.25 H 1 and 0.25 E 1. 

For a total time frame of 15 years the total Risk (according to relation 2) is: 

### TR = tbefore/Tt A Xbefore + tduring/Tt A Xduring + tafter/Tt A Xafter 

### A1: 0/15 A (H 1 +E 1 ) + 5/15 A 0.875 (H 1 +E 1 ) + 10/15 A 0.75 (H 1 +E 1 ) = 0.79 

### A2: 5/15 A (H 1 +E 1 ) + 10/15 A 0.625 (H 1 +E 1 ) + 0/15 A 0.25 (H 1 +E 1 ) = 0.75 

As long as the exposure of humans and the ecosystem is below specific evaluation criteria (that are considered to be boundary conditions for all remedial alternatives), and the Total risk is more or less the same, it is not possible to discriminate between options A1 and A2. 

However, from a psychological point of view, it is possible that option A1 is perceived as lower risk, because within this alternative the risk reduction starts immediately. Note that is the total time frame that is evaluated has a large impact in this case on the total risk. If we consider a time frame of 50 years, option A2 will end up with considerable lower Total risk than option A1. We will come back to the aspect of total time frame in paragraph 2.3.4. 

Example 3Example 3 In the last example the following options are compared: 

B1 Human exposure in year 0 is H 1 , remediation starts at year 8, final situation will be achieved in year 20 at 0.1 H 1. B2 Human exposure in year 0 is H 1 , remediation starts at year 0, final situation will be achieved in year 5 at 0.7 H 1. 

The total risk in the time frame of 20 years will be: 

B1 = 0.73 B2 = 0.74 

If a longer time frame will be considered, option B1 will be preferred. 

Applying discounting-principles on risks has the advantage that the perception of people that risks now are more important than risks tomorrow is quantified. It is not clear what discount rate describes this process adequately. However, if risks would be discounted, options that decrease risks in the beginning of the considered time frame will be favoured above options that take more time but arrive at lower exposure levels. The remaining risk levels at year 20 or later in time do not contribute any more to the total assessment of risk reduction. This is not in line with the long-term perspective of soil remediation, and the concept of 'sustainability'. 


As was explained in chapter 1, REC doesn't take all the relevant evaluation criteria for remediation alternatives into account. The social, political and psychological aspects were considered to be too case-specific to incorporate into an objective, quantitative method. Therefore, in this phase of the project, risks will not be discounted. 

2.3.3 Discounting environmental influences 

As can be seen in the general expression for Environmental merit, the building blocks are also a function of time. Is it necessary to evaluate the use of scarce commodities in year 1 different from the use in year 10? And are emissions that may have influence on environmental quality more serious in year 1 than in year 5? 

A distinction must be made between the use of scarce commodities and the potential influencing of environmental quality. It can be supported that in case of use of scarce commodities, it is the use itself that matters, not the moment or speed in which this happens. In case of aspects that may influence environmental quality, it is more likely that the distribution of the emissions in time, does actually determine the extent to which environmental quality is influenced. Since we have chosen to evaluate potential influence on the environment, it is not necessary to take the time-value of environmental influences into account. However, this will remain a topic for discussion. 

2.3.4 Total time frame to be regarded 

As was already mentioned in one of the examples of paragraph 2.3.2, the total time frame that will be considered may have significant impact on the final quantification of the criteria that do not use discounting principles. It is possible to define several time frames that may be considered, such as: 

1. the time of the most-time consuming alternative: ttotal = tlongest alternative (minimal time frame); 

2. one generation: ttotal = t30 years; 

3. lifetime: ttotal = t70 years; 

4. a century: ttotal = t100 years. 

It is recommended to investigate, case by case, if increasing the time frame has significant impact on the REC-scores. 

2.4 Process to arrive at integrated score within one criteriumProcess to arrive at integrated score within one criterium 

The process to arrive at an integrated score on the criteria Risk reduction, Environmental merit and Costs is similar, and will be discussed here in general terms. This process is presented in figure 2.3. 


Fig. 2.3. Overview of process of defining REC-criteria. 

First the criterium needs to be defined and positioned into the context. The philosophy behind the criterium must be described. Then the relevant aspects that need to be incorporated in the criterium are selected and motivated. The selected aspects will be operationalized: it must be described in detail how to assess the aspect in a quantitative way. The final step is to integrate the separate, quantified aspects into one criterium. In this final step, weighting of the aspects is introduced. It is customary to distinguish between two types of weights: technical weights, which represent established and scientifically sound evidence, and policy weights, which are the result of subjective evaluations. The first type of weights is often used to integrate pieces of information with a technical nature. Weights can usually be related to the state of the art, science or to accepted practice and be often set in an uncontroversial way. On the other hand, the weights applied to entire evaluation sectors usually represent policy priorities an need to be assessed by the users. In REC, all type of weights will be made transparent and available for user changes.

### RISK REDUCTIONRISK REDUCTION 

3.1 SummarySummary 

In this chapter a proposal for an assessment procedure for 'risk reduction' is described. The philosophy behind this criterium is to determine the total impact of the remediation strategy and method on the total risk for different objects such as humans, ecosystem, infrastructure and so on. The approach will be object-path-source oriented: starting with a site specific description of objects, their behaviour, site specific information and finally, the relation to the contamination present in soil and groundwater. Although the REC-method tries to integrate all risk aspects in one criterium, in this stage of the project we focus on exposure to the soil contamination and not on the risk for calamities. At this moment, the following aspects are identified to be considered in Risk reduction: people at the site or in the surroundings, remedial workers, ecosystem, infrastructure (underground cables & pipes), and other objects that need to be protected like vegetation and cattle. 

The first step in the risk reduction assessment is to define the threatened objects. This starts by an inventory of objects on the site and in the immediate surroundings. Separate areas may be distinguished, representing a different type of exposure for objects. The exposure scenario for the people on or around the site and the remedial workers need to be defined as precisely as possible, taking into account the 'expected' behaviour, given the present lay out of the site. If one of the remedial alternatives does not start at t = 0, or doesn't contain the contamination, it must be checked whether or not other objects will be threatened in the future, given the time span to be evaluated (i.e., system boundaries for risk reduction assessment). 

Once the exposure scenario's for the several groups are defined, it is necessary to establish the concentration of contaminants in the contact media for the different objects. This can be achieved by measuring (for t = 0) or calculation with exposure models, (necessary to predict concentrations in contact media during the course of the remediation). Assessment of risk reduction for people on the site and remedial workers will be based on comparison of actual exposure. Assessment of risk reduction for the ecosystem will be based on an estimation of percentage species at risk in a certain surface area. To end up with risk reduction, it is necessary to define an anchor point which serves as a reference for the total risk (TR 0 ). Comparison of this anchor point with the total risk (TR) results in risk reduction of a specific remedial option. The quantified scores on risk reduction for several alternatives can than be compared. The anchor point is defined as the total risk at the time of the REC-assessment (t = 0), taken into account the total time frame that is regarded, without remediation. 

The assessment of the total risk demands an integration of several risk indices, such as risk for people on or in the surroundings of the site, remedial workers, the ecosystem, underground infrastructure and other objects. The procedure to assess the separate risk indices must take into account that the indices will be added. This means that, if all the aspects are evaluated as equally important, the numerical values of the separate indices must represent the risk weighed to the other indices. It must therefore be defined what level of exposure of people during what time is evaluated as important as a certain level of exposure of the ecosystem. By implementing weight factors in the formula to calculate the final risk reduction it is possible to insert additional preferences to evaluate the separate risk indices differently. 

3.2 Definition and contextDefinition and context 3.2.1 Definition of Risk and Risk reduction 

Before relevant aspects in the scope of the subject risk reduction can be identified, the term risk has to be defined. Based on the results of discussions with participants of the REC-project and on internal discussions, the following definition is proposed: 

Risk: all forms of exposure related to the regarded soil contamination, both as a result of the contamination itself and as a result of the execution of the evaluated remediation alternative, which may lead to negative effects on the health of people living in the affected area, on the health of workers involved 


in the realisation of the regarded remedial option, on the state of the ecosystem or on the state of other objects, and which is regarded as not expressible in costs. 

With the presented risk definition, the following remarks have to be made: 

- The used definition implies that not only risks related to exposure to contaminants should be     regarded, but also risks resulting from exposure to calamities such as traffic accidents, explosions and     collapses, both due to the soil contamination itself and to the execution of the remedial option. It     should be realised that the first class of exposure has a chronic character and has to be judged     based on its intensity (amount of exposure relative to accepted thresholds), while the latter class has     an incidental character and has to be judged based on its likelihood of occurrence. 

- It is important to prevent an overlap with the REC-element cost reduction. It is necessary     to separate risks that can be expressed in costs (for example the replacement     of a tree) and risks that can not be expressed in costs : negative health effects to     people and to workers (they are not replaceable). Therefore, in the criterium risk reduction only those     aspects are incorporated that cannot be expressed in costs. 

3.2.2 The object-path-source orientation 

In the assessment of Risk reduction, the line of thinking will be from object through pathways to sources of exposure. This implies that the Risk reduction assessment procedure starts with the identification of relevant objects that are under consideration. After identification the objects must be defined: a site specific characterization of the behaviour of objects must lead to a reliable, representative exposure scenario. Then the impact of several sources of exposure (water, air, food and soil contamination), related to the objects is evaluated. If possible, site specific measurements of contact media will be used, combined with predictions of the future exposure. 

3.2.3 Short description of national developments 

In the past decade a lot of work was done on the development of risk assessment procedures and methodologies. The extensive work of the RIVM in the projects for derivation of intervention values has lead to an increased awareness of the importance of risk based standards and risk based decision making. The development of the exposure model CSOIL (in close cooperation with Shell and DSM, ECETOC) has lead to several applications in practise, and has been used in the definition of the method for assessment of urgency of remediation. Risk assessment is also one of the corner stones of the BSB approach (remediation of industrial sites currently in use). However it must be stressed that in this priority setting a combination is made between 'environmental risk assessment' and 'financial and legal risk assessment' (liability). The VNG assigned the RIVM to work out a method for the evaluation of soil quality in relation to construction and building licenses. In the Soil Protection Act, the use of risk assessment in soil investigation and soil remediation is embedded, for example in describing the method for determination of urgency, and by setting boundary conditions for Isolation, Containment and Control alternatives, based on risk assessment. There are several computer applications available nowadays, such as SUS (Sanerings Urgentie Systematiek, Van Hall Institute), CSOIL6.3 (Tauw), and HESP (Shell). In the development of the risk reduction criterium we will use the existing knowledge as good as possible. However, since we adopt the object-path-source approach, adjustments of these models will be necessary. 

3.2.4 Short description of international developments 

It is commonly accepted in most countries, that risks for humans and the ecosystem from soil contamination is not allowed. As a consequence, soil remediation is needed, when it is shown that a contaminated site does present an actual risk. Therefore, a risk assessment is needed to evaluate the need and urgency of a remediation for a situation of soil contamination. 

The concept of risk assessment of a soil contamination is similar for most countries, whereas the practical implementation may vary for the different nations. Unacceptable risk for humans exists, if human exposure at the site, that is caused by the soil contamination, does exceed a human toxicological standard. In a similar way, risks for the ecosystem can be assessed. 


Consequently, in the different countries exposure models are developed to estimate human exposure from a soil contamination. Known models are: the Dutch CSOIL model, the HESP model, the German UMS model, the CLEA model from the UK, and the RBCA for the US and Canada. Some of them are very well described and available as a computer application, whereas others are still in an experimental stage. They share the concept of exposure assessment and toxicological standards, but do differ for the sub models calculating exposure and toxicological endpoints. Most kind of differences are relevant as the different countries do show a different environmental policy, and different type of behaviour that influences human exposure. 

In conclusion it can be stated, that the concept of risk assessment of contaminated soil is generally identical all over the world. By the use of exposure models, that are scientifically well established, a major part of the risk assessment for humans is similar for most countries. Differences are to be expected, caused by different environmental regulations, human behaviour and country specific data on meteorological situation, and so on. Therefore, for calculation of risk reduction by soil remediation, acceptance of the method will be significant when using the general concept of exposure exceeding an unacceptable risk level. However, it will be essential that the REC-method provides for freedom to adapt the risk reduction assessment procedure to national standards, values and norms. 


3.3 Identification of relevant aspects for Risk reductionIdentification of relevant aspects for Risk reduction 

Given the object path source orientation of the risk reduction assessment, it is necessary to start with the identification of threatened objects on the site and in the immediate surroundings, expected to be affected by the soil contamination. According to the risk definition, the following classes of threatened objects are judged as important: 

1. people living or working in the system; 

2. workers involved in the evaluated remediation alternative; 

3. ecosystem situated in the system; 

4. specific constructions/infrastructure for which damage may pose a risk for humans or the     ecosystem; 

5. individual flora or fauna that is needed to be protected separately. 

With respect to the assessment of the relevance of each object for the evaluation process, the following decision schemes will be used: 

1. People living or working in the system

*: only relevant if negative effects to the object are regarded as not expressible in costs. 

System area After evaluation of the potentially threatened objects, and before determining the exposure scenario for each object in detail, it is necessary to check whether or not there can be additional objects identified, that may be at risk in a future situation. This may take place in cases, where the remedial activities will take place after a certain 'delay period' in which spread of the contamination may lead to exposure for new objects. Another possibility is that one of the remedial options doesn't contain the contamination (fully). In these instances it is necessary to define the system area for the assessment of risk reduction. 

It depends on the level of detail of the REC-assessment, and on the available information how the system area is determined. First, a rough evaluation of the surroundings is made, to find out if there are sensitive objects that may be at risk in the future. If this is the case, it may be useful to make a rough estimation of the spread of the contamination within the regarded time period. 

Types of exposure including background exposure In order to be able to consider the relevance of exposure reduction by soil remediation related to the total exposure, we propose to include background exposure into the REC-assessment procedure, as far as possible. By background exposure is meant the industry or activity specific background exposure 


(such as benzene at gasoline stations or chlorinated solvents at dry cleaning shops) as well as the background exposure by other sources (via food, air, etc.). This will probably be worked out in phase 2 of the project. 

The exposure posed to the discerned threatened objects can be expressed in a general scheme as presented below. The discerned types of exposure and relevant exposure routes will be briefly discussed in the following text.

Given the discerned sources, the following possible forms of exposure can be discerned, which may be applicable to one or more of the discerned threatened objects: 

1. exposure to contaminants originated from the soil contamination; 

2. exposure to contaminants liberated due to the execution of the remedial option; 

3. exposure to contaminants originated from external sources; 

4. exposure to calamities due to the soil contamination; 

5. exposure to calamities due to the execution of the remedial option; 

6. exposure to direct effects of the execution of the remedial option such as lowering of the     groundwater table and excavation of soil. 

In the scope of the evaluation of added risk, a separate form will be regarded: 

7. exposure to calamities due to external sources. 

The relevance and a first indication of the possibility for quantification of each exposure type for each discerned class of vulnerable objects is listed in table 3.1. This table will form the base of the operationalization and quantification of risk reduction for the selected aspects (objects).

3.4 Operationalization of selected aspectsOperationalization of selected aspects 3.4.1 Detailing general expression Risk reduction 

Given the aim of the REC-project, the required procedure must enable quantification of the total risk for possible remedial options compared to Total risk TR 0. Risk reduction was defined in paragraph 2.1.1. as: 

 Risk reductionRisk reduction = TR 0 TRi (3) 

in which: 

### RiskRisk : R = Xi A t (1) 

in which: R is Risk; X is normalized 'total exposure'; i is remediation alternative i; t is time. 

In this paragraph, X must be operationalized. 

As mentioned before, two types of risks are of importance: 

1. risks related to exposure to contaminants; 

2. risks related to exposure to certain calamities. 

Exposure to contaminants can be quantified as follows: 

### Xexposure contaminants = RIndex A n 

in which: RIndex is a risk index, equal to the amount of exposure, divided by an applicable toxicological threshold value (RIndex = Exposure/Toxicological threshold value); n is the number of exposed objects. 


Exposure to calamities can be quantified as: 

### Xexposure calamities = L A S 

in which: L is likelihood of occurrence calamity; S is "seriousness factor". 

In this stage, this paper will further focus on exposure risks. Risks for calamities can be discussed in a phase II of the project. 

3.4.2 Quantification of exposure (X) to contaminants 

In the following text, applicable formulas will be discussed for people, workers and the ecosystem. Subsequently, the potential of integration of these formulas will be regarded. 

People living or working in the system For this group, the exposure to contaminants originated from the soil contamination could be quantified, using the following formula: 

### X = RIndex A n 

in which: RIndex is exposure/TDI; n is number of exposed individuals at the site. 

The first step is to define the applicable exposure scenario given the site specific situation. This exposure scenario is used for the calculation (thereby using the formularium of exposure models). If a zoning into areas with different exposure situations could be made and/or subgroups can be discerned, this formula can be separated into elements for each zone and/or subgroup (for example children and adults, working and living area, and so on). 

Workers involved in the evaluated remediation alternative With respect to the quantification of the exposure of workers, it could be assumed that protection equipment is fully effective, implying that only exposure due to inhalation of dust and vapours in class 1T remediation zones and exposure to vapours in class 2T remediation zones has to be taken into account. Such exposure will probably mainly be limited to remediations involving excavation of contaminated materials. For workers, the exposure to contaminants during the remedial work could be quantified once the exposure scenario is defined, taking into account a proper evaluation value, for example the MAC-value. The MAC-value is commonly accepted to describe allowable exposure for working individuals. The MAC-value accounts for lower vulnerability, lower exposure time fractions and a lower total exposure period for workers compared to people (40 years instead of 70). Thus, the exposure to soil contamination during the remediation could be quantified as follows: 

### X = RIndex A n 

in which: RIndex is exposure/MAC; n is number of exposed workers. 


Ecosystem situated in the system area Due to a lack of a quantitative, species-specific model for the exposure of ecosystems to soil contamination and the lack of a system for the judging of the value of different ecosystem types, a species-specific or ecosystem-specific exposure-assessment is not yet possible. 

In the assessment of ecological risks, a number of aspects are important, which follow the same conceptual approach as the evaluation of human exposure: 

 Riskecosystem = Exposureecosystem/Toxicological thresholdecosystem. 

Exposure ecosystem Although there is an immediate contact between soil species and soil contamination, the exposure of an ecosystem is related to the accessibility of the area. In case there is an intensive exchange between parts of the ecosystem (for example via the food chain) and the possibilities for a high variety in soil species are large, the accessibility of the area is evaluated as large. In fully accessible areas, such as natural reserves, the total number of types of flora, fauna and microorganism per m^2 is large, and maximal contact between species and the soil contamination is possible. In less accessible areas such as urban areas or industrial areas, the disturbing factors as underground infrastructure, pavement, and so on lead to a smaller number of different species per m^2. The total surface area that can be contaminated before a specific number of species is at risk is therefore larger in less accessible areas. The critical surface to arrive at a certain degree of "ecological accessibility", has been set (urgency determination, Soil Protection Act) at 50 mÂ² for natural areas, 5,000 mÂ² for urban and agricultural areas and 500,000 mÂ² for industrial, barren and city areas. 

Toxicological threshold ecosystem It is proposed to assess the effects soil contamination has on the potential, relative number of species, using available HC 50 values. For a number of contaminants, HC 50 values have been derived. If one assumes that for each contaminant, the concentration/HC function has the same shape, we can derive a concentration/threatened species function for each contaminant for which a HC 50 value is available, describing the concentration in soil versus the percentage of species protected. The number of species at risk will be divided by 50, which is proposed to be taken as the threshold for ecosystems (comparable to TDI for humans). Thus, the exposure to soil contamination could be quantified as follows: 

### X = RIndex A n 

in which: RIndex is % unprotected species/50; n is influenced surface/critical surface (50, 5,0000 of 500,000 m^2 ). 

The ecological exposure index can be calculated as follows: 

- for natural areas: 

### X = % unprotected species/50 A influenced surface (mÂ²)/50 (mÂ²) 

- for urban and agricultural areas: 

### X = % unprotected species/50 A influenced surface (mÂ²)/5,000 (mÂ²) 

- for industrial, barren and city areas: 

### X = % unprotected species/50 A influenced surface (mÂ²)/500,000 (mÂ²) 

3.4.3 Exceeding toxicological thresholds 

A potential problem with the quantification could be the comparison of exposure situations where threshold values such as TDI (for people), MAC (for workers) and HC 50 (for ecosystems) are exceeded with situations in which these values are not exceeded. However, as a general rule, remedial options which will lead to situations in which exceedence of thresholds such as TDI, MAC or HC 50 may remain, are regarded as not acceptable. However, the time necessary to achieve an exposure level below the 


mentioned thresholds can differ for several options. This needs further attention in the determination of risk reduction. In the presented proposal for quantification, risk reduction above threshold values is weighted equally to risk reduction below threshold values. This aspect can be tackled by implementing an additional weight factor in the formula. 

3.4.4 Exposure to mixtures of compounds 

In the operationalization of the assessment of mixtures of chemical compounds, it is proposed to subscribe the Dutch method of defining actual risks for humans and the ecosystem. There it is assumed, that toxicity of mixtures is additive for different groups of compounds, with toxic resemblances, such as PAHs, chlorophenols, and others. Accordingly, all RIndexs of all chemicals within such a predefined group are to be summed up. Exposure (X) must then be calculated using the total of RIndexs, for humans and the ecosystem, separately. For the different groups of mixtures, one must follow the total procedure of integration to obtain the total Risk reduction per group. 

3.4.5 Overview of inputs in quantification 

In table 3.2 , an overview is given of the inputs used with the proposed assessment of risks to people living or working in the system area, workers involved in the remediation and the ecosystem. 

Table 3.2. Overview of inputs used with the proposed risk quantification assessments. 

 vulnerable objectstoxicological thresholdn t people TDI number of people total time workers MAC number of workers remediation period ecosystem HC 50 influenced area/critical surfacetotal time 

3.5 Integration of the quantified aspectsIntegration of the quantified aspects 

Before integration of the quantified aspects, the total exposure as a function of time (X) has to be transformed to Risk, by multiplying the exposure with the time period of this exposure (see formula 1). To arrive at risk reduction, the total risk (TR) is subtracted from the anchor point, defined as the total risk that would occur if the exposure at t = 0 would maintain during the total time span. The risk reduction for the separate aspects can thus be calculated. 

With respect to the integration of the risks for exposure of people, workers and the ecosystem to contaminants, one must add the risk reduction for the separate aspects that are evaluated, as the underlying toxicological threshold that is used to normalize the exposure are regarded as having the same societal meaning. However, it can be expected, that the user of REC wants to weigh the separate aspects differently. Therefore, additional weight factors are to be inserted in the next expression: 

### Risk reduction = E0 (EbeforeAtbefore/Tt + EduringAtduring/Tt + EafterAtafter/Tt 

### E0 = Wp A E0people, before remediation A Tt/Tt 

### + We A E0ecosystem, before remediation A Tt/Tt 

### Ebefore = Wp A E1people, before remediation A a/Tt 

### + We A E1ecosystem, before remediation A a/Tt 

### Eduring = Wp A E1people, during remediation A b/Tt 

### + Ww A E1workers, during remediation A b/Tt 

### + We A E1ecosystem, during remediation A b/Tt 

### Eafter = Wp A E1people, after remediation A c/Tt 

### + We A E1ecosystem, after remediation A c/Tt 

in which: 


 Wp is weight factor, people; Ww is weight factor, workers; We is weight factor, ecosystem; Tt is total time; a is time before remediation starts (after t = 0); b is remediation time; c is remaining time period (a + b + c = Tt). 

Two arguments are applicable in weighing the relevance of the different objects: population, remedial workers, and ecosystem. First, differences in maximal tolerable exposure are normalized by the distinct toxicological threshold values (TDI, MAC, resp. HC 50 ), and number of exposed humans versus critical surface area for the ecosystem. Accordingly, differences in environmental policy is taken care of, and all three objects can be weighed equally. Additional weight factors should therefore embody social choices on the differences between the objects. The second argument is the minor likelihood of combinations with equal relevance for the humans and ecosystem. For example: for a excavation option in a densely populated area the population and workers will show a equally high relative exposure risk, whereas risk for the ecosystem could be assumed to be rather low. Vice versa, high risk for the ecosystem can be expected in a natural reserve with a rather low risk for the population and remedial workers. Hence, whether humans or the ecosystem will define the total risk for all subjects into a great extent in most cases. Additional weight factors can be expected not to be discriminating.

### ENVIRONMENTAL MERITENVIRONMENTAL MERIT 

4.1 SummarySummary 

In this chapter a proposal for the assessment for 'environmental merit' is described. The proposed definition of environmental merit in this chapter is: the outcome of an integral evaluation of potential environmental influences of the contamination and its remediation, whereby these potential influences are not restricted to a specific site. Environmental merit will be based on the quantification of 'use of the environment', thereby not including the actual effects of this 'environmental use'. This choice avoids detailed discussion on the environmental effects. The term 'environmental influences' relates to scarcity of commodities and potential influence on environmental quality. The proposed procedure only covers the most substantial environmental influences, and uses data that are available in the daily practise of soil remediation. 

The improved soiland groundwaterquality and prevention of future spreading is regarded as positive inlfluence. The use of scarce commodities (soil, groundwater, drinkingwater, space and energy) and influences on the environmental quality (air and water emissions), are identified as negative aspects. Some aspects of remediation activities are considered to be not relevant for the environmental merit calculation, such as the use of chemicals and other materials. 

Some aspects have been operationalized by an equivalent-definition. This has been done for: the actual improvement of soil and groundwater quality, the prevention of future soil and groundwater contamination, the use of clean soil and groundwater and emissions to the surface water and air. For the calculation of the prevention of future soil and groundwater contamination a rough estimation of spreading is made: a calculation of maximum potential spreading gives an overestimation of the actual environmental influence. Other influences are operationalized in the following units: drinkingwater in m^3 , energy in MJ and space in m^2. 

The integration of the operationalized aspects is executed in two steps. First by combining the aspects with the same unit: the different soil and groundwater aspects. Then the different scores have been standardized by relating them to a default situation with a most desirable and least desirable outcome on every aspect. The weighing of the different aspects is not done in this report, because further research is needed on this point. The weighing can be done by the users of the method. 

4.2 Definition and contextDefinition and context 

In this paragraph we will elaborate on the concept and definition of Environmental merit. Also, the relevant developments in the Netherlands and abroad will be discussed. 

4.2.1 Definition of environmental influences and Environmental merit 

Before identifying the relevant aspects for the assessment of environmental merit the criterium itself has to be defined. The proposed definition must be regarded as a working definition: 

Environmental merit is the outcome of an integral evaluation of potential environmental influences of the contamination and its remediation, whereby these potential influences are not restricted to a specific site. 

As was already explained in chapter 2, a choice has been made to relate environmental merit directly to the causes (past or present human activities) at the third level of the cause-effect relation ship, the so called 'use of the environment'. This choice is motivated as follows: 

- It makes the method applicable for the practice of remediation nowadays, because it is easier to relate     environmental merit to the direct outputs of the remediation than to relate it to real effects on the     environment. Uncertainties about the likelihood of occurrence (for example the greenhouse effect),     and the impact of time and place of emissions on the actual environmental quality make an actual     environmental assessment very complex. 


- By using the REC-method to compare and optimize alternatives, general insight in the environmental     influences of remediation activities to the user provides for information to assess if there are major     differences between alternatives, and what activities cause these differences. This can be done     without a detailed discussion on the environmental effects. 

As can be seen in the definition, environmental merit only accounts for those environmental influences that have no direct relation with objects near the site, to prevent obvious overlap with Risk reduction. This means that it is assumed that the place where the outputs of the remediation take place is regarded as irrelevant for the assessment of environmental merit. Note that if emissions on the site lead to health risks, this will be included in the assessment of Risk reduction. 

First we will elaborate on the term 'environmental influences', because these are the building blocks of the criterium environmental merit. Environmental influences will be regarded from two perspectives: 

1. Scarce commodities     This perspective relates to the concept that cycles of materials should be closed because of the     scarcity of (raw) materials. This perspective is often referred to as 'Sustainable development' or     'responsibility for future generations'. 

2. Environmental quality     This perspective relates to the effect of emissions (solid, liquid or gas) on the environment on a local,     regional and global scale. 

Both perspectives will be taken into account in the evaluation of aspects to be included in Environmental merit. 

Since one of the boundary conditions for this project is formed by the practical applicability of the method it will not be possible and desired to account for all causes of environmental influences. So in this stage of the development of the REC-method the aim is to incorporate the most substantial environmental influences. 

4.2.2 Short description of national and international developments 

There is a growing awareness on the relevance of the environmental impact of remediation in the Netherlands. Several reports have been made in trying to assess the environmental impact of remediation. Some of these reports focus mainly on the environmental impact of remediation techniques, like reports from TAUW and POSW (LCA application for the selection of remedial option for sediment remediation), while others make a more integral calculation of environmental, social and financial criteria, like studies from the universities of Twente (vergelijking saneringsopties), Delft and Rotterdam (both consider environmental efficiency) and a study from TAUW (milieurendement). Many of these investigations are not adjusted to the data availability of the normal practice of remedial investigations, and therefore hard to apply. Other reports concentrate on a decision model for remediation options, like Bosland (RIVM/IVM). Methods that are based on the current remediation practice and partly consider environmental efficiency, are "Beoordelingsmethodiek voor saneringsvarian ten" (TAUW) and "Rendement van saneringsvarianten" (Province Utrecht). There are also reports that concentrate on one of the aspects of REC, risk reduction, such as "risicorendement" (TAUW). A similar scope as REC has the feasibility study "risicogestuurd saneren" (RIVM). In conclusion it can be stated, that the attention for environmental impact of remediation is growing, but there is no general method that combines a thorough evaluation of risks, environmental impact and other criteria such as costs and social aspects. It appears to be difficult to implement the developed methods (like LCA) in the remediation practice. International developments on LCA are discussed and coordinated in SETAC. 

4.3 Identification of relevant aspects for Environmental meritIdentification of relevant aspects for Environmental merit 

In this paragraph, the identification of environmental influences, and the selection of the aspects that are considered to be of most significance will be discussed. 

As was defined in paragraph 2.1.2, environmental influences may be regarded as positive (i.e. improvement of soil and groundwater quality) and negative (i.e. emissions to water and air). 


EnvironmentalEnvironmental meritmerit refers to the integrated score of environmental influences, where the negative environmental influences are subtracted from the positive influences. 

 Environmental meritEnvironmental merit = TEIi, positive aspects TEIi, negative aspects (6) 

The positive aspects of environmental merit are considered to be one of the driving forces for remediation (next to risk reduction), where the negative aspects are the unwanted environmental influences that are needed to arrive at the remediation goal. Regarding the remediation as a black box, this can be expressed in terms of inand outputs (see fig. 4.1): 

 inputs Environmental influence of: 1) presence of Soil contamination 2) remedial activities 

 positive outputs (cleaned soil/ groundwater) 

 negative outputs (emissions) 

Fig. 4.1. Schematic presentation of Environmental influences. 

The three perspectives of environmental influences will be discussed in the following sections. 

4.3.1 Benefits for the environment: positive outputs 

The first perspective to be operationalized is the assessment of the benefits of the remediation in terms of improvement of the soil and groundwater quality. As was already mentioned, this perspective is one of the driving forces for the remediation. Within this perspective, the benefits for the environment will be assessed. In remediation practice, two main types of alternatives are considered: 

A. improving soil quality and groundwater quality by removing the contamination (by excavation and off site treatment or in situ); B. preventing future contamination by containment measures. 

Regarding the benefits for the environment, these two alternatives differ significantly in their contribution to improvement of the soil and groundwater quality. In both alternatives, the potential future contamination of soil and groundwater is prevented. However, in the first alternative, also the existing quality of contaminated soil and groundwater is improved. The total benefits for the environment by remediation thus exist of two parts: 

1. actual improvement of existing soil- and groundwater quality; 

2. prevention of future soil- and groundwater contamination. 

Both parts, for soil as well as for groundwater will be incorporated into environmental merit. Note that excavated soil that is not treated but disposed on a waste site doesn't contribute to the improvement of soil quality, and therefore will not be counted as positive output. 

4.3.2 Sacrifices for the environment: negative inputs 

To reach the goal of the remediation, a number of scarce commodities are used. All kinds of equipment and materials are needed to execute the remedial activities. In the scope of the REC-method, it is proposed to limit the assessment of the negative inputs mainly to primary inputs, the resources that are used directly in the remedial activities. The so-called secondary and tertiary inputs, necessary to produce the equipments used are not included, except for the use of electricity. In several studies it was indicated that these inputs do not have significant impact on the total quantity of used commodities, and therefore do not have discriminating power. 

To make an inventory of primary inputs in the remediation alternatives, these alternatives have to be described in detail. In Annexe A, an example of a schematic representation of the process of remediation is presented. For every step in the process, the inputs need to be defined, leading to the following list: 


1. clean soil; 

2. clean groundwater; 

3. drinking water; 

4. energy; 

5. space; 

6. chemicals (nutrients, conditioners, etc.); 

7. materials used during remediation (piping, water treatment installation, sheet pile walls, etc.). 

- Clean soil     In some alternatives, the contaminated soil is replaced by clean soil from another source. This is     considered to be a negative input of the remediation process. 

- Clean groundwater     During the groundwater remediation, an amount of clean groundwater is extracted to flush the     contaminated zone. 


- Drinking water     In some alternatives, clean water is infiltrated in the soil. If drinking water is used for this purpose,     this is considered to be a negative environmental input. 

- Energy     Energy that originates from fossil fuels is considered to be not renewable, and is evaluated a scarce     commodity. 

- Space     Space is also considered to be scarce in the Netherlands. In this aspect, the use of space for     installations and storage of final waste (including soil that is not treated) are counted. Besides this,     the space that will be used additionally, because of restrictions for use at the contaminated site     will be taken into account. 

From this list of inputs, these five inputs will be incorporated into the assessment of Environmental merit. 

- Chemicals     The chemicals that are used in the treatment process are considered to be no scarce commodities.     There is no driving force to minimize the use of these chemicals, other than economic driving forces,     so this will be reflected in the cost-criterium. 

- Materials     The materials that are used in the remediation are not 'consumed' during the remediation: after the     remediation stops, the installation will be removed. The steel sheet pile walls will be available for     further use, the plastic pipes can be recycled, and so on. So it is assumed, that the 'occupation' of     materials during the remediation doesn't have significant impact on the environment. 

The inputs 'chemicals' and 'materials' will not be included into the environmental merit criterium. 

4.3.3 Sacrifices for the environment: negative outputs 

The quality of the environment can be affected as a result of emissions of the remedial activities. In this paragraph, air, water and solid emissions are considered. 

Air emissions Air emissions as outputs of soil contamination and soil remediation are caused by two aspects: 

1. the evaporation of the contamination; 

2. the combustion of fuel: 

- directly, by the use of fuel for pumps, transports, etc.; 

- indirectly, by the production of electricity. 

The first aspect, evaporation of the contamination is evaluated in the Risk reduction criterium, thereby relating the evaporation to specific objects. The contribution of evaporation of contamination to the total air emissions is negligible, and therefore considered not to be significant for the assessment of environmental merit. The second aspect is considered to be relevant. The combustion of fuel can be related to different potential effects on the environment like climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, photochemical smog formation, eutrophication and acidification. So the use of (non renewable) energy will serve as an approx for all the negative outputs of remediation, related to the fore mentioned environmental influences. 


Water emissions Water emissions as outputs of soil remediation are caused by the extraction of groundwater for dry excavation, groundwater remediation or containment. The extracted water that is infiltrated in the soil (after treatment) is considered to be no emission. The (nett) emission of water can be wasted into the sewer system or at the surface water. Water emissions are regulated in quantity and quality. If the water is emitted to the sewer system, this water will be treated in the treatment system for the total water flow in the sewer system. It is assumed that the impact of the water emission to the sewer system on the efficiency of the water treatment system is negligible. So, emissions on the sewer system are considered to have no environmental influence. If the water is emitted to the surface water, the surface water quality may be influenced. This depends on the quantity and quality (load) of the emission, and will be included as a negative output. 

Solid emissions Besides air and water emissions, remedial activities may lead to the production of solid waste (sludge, contaminated soil). Solid waste has no influence on the environmental quality as long as the solid waste is stored safely. The storage of waste has impact on the use of the scarce commodity 'space'. If solid waste is incinerated, the impact on the environment is evaluated on the basis of energy consumption and the emissions of energy consumption. In the REC-method, the emission of solid waste is not evaluated as such, but is incorporated in the aspect 'space' or 'energy'. 

Summary identification relevant aspects In Environmental merit, the inputs and outputs that are selected can be divided into aspects affecting environmental quality and factors affecting the use of scarce commodities.

4.4 Operationalization of selected aspectsOperationalization of selected aspects 

In this paragraph the selected aspects will be operationalized: the procedure for quantification of the separate aspects will be discussed. 

4.4.1 Benefits for the environment: positive outputs 

For the quantification of the positive outputs for the environment, a distinction must be made between 1) the actual improvement of soil quality and 2) the prevention of potential soil contamination. 


Actual improvement of soil and groundwater quality For the assessment of the improvement of soil and groundwater quality, the existing contamination situation at the time of the REC-evaluation is compared with the final contamination situation at the end of the remediation (as a function of time necessary to achieve this). 

The improvement of soil and groundwaterquality can be related to specific standards for these compartments. It must be discussed what standards are applicable for the operationalization of this aspect. In this phase, we use the existing Dutch soiland groundwaterstandards as an example. 

In this quantification, the total volume (m^3 soil and groundwater) contaminated above the S-values (clean soil standards) will be considered. However, a decrease in concentrations from Ito T-value is considered to be an improvement, and needs to be included into the environmental benefit. Therefore, the total volume will be combined with the level of contamination. Every m^3 soil contaminated above I-level must be counted 0 % improvement, every m^3 clean soil 100 % improvement. Assuming a linear relation between Sand I-value, every m^3 soil and groundwater can be counted for a specific percentage, related to the final concentration achieved in this m^3. (see fig. 4.2) 

Fig. 4.2. Linear r e l a t i o n a n d step function between soil and groundwater quality and %-benefit. 

For practical reasons (i.e. the availability of data from soil investigation), it is suggested to use a step function, that distinguishes four categories of soil and groundwater quality: 

I. < S-values: clean soil^ 100% benefit II. S-T-values: 67% benefit III. T-I-values: 33% benefit IV. > I-values: seriously contaminated 0% benefit 

In the categorizing of a volume contaminated soil, the most important contamination determines the quality factor. So in case of a combination of contaminations, a certain volume is assigned to category II if all the contaminations are in category II or I. 

In this way, the contamination situation is translated into lean Soil equivalents, Seq, and clean groundWater equivalents, Weq. 

### clean Soil equivalents = Seq = E Vsoilyj A %y 

### clean groundWater equivalents = Weq = E Vgrwateryj A %y 

in which: 


 Vyj is volume (m^3 ) with concentration y of substance j; %y is % benefit, related to quality categories I to IV. 

The following example illustrates the quantification of the actual improvement of soil and groundwater quality. 

ExampleExample Contamination situation t = 0: 

- 100 m 

(^3) contaminated soil: 25 m (^3) > I-value; 25 m (^3) T-I; 50 m (^3) S-T; 

- 1000 m^3 contaminated groundwater: 250 m^3 > I-value; 250 m^3 T-I; 500 m^3 S-T. 

Contamination situation t = end: 

- 10 m 

(^3) contaminated soil: 10 m (^3) S-T; 90 m (^3) clean soil; 

- 200 m^3 contaminated groundwater: 10 m^3 T-I; 190 m^3 S-T; 800 m^3 clean groundwater. 

First the total contamination at t = 0 is expressed in clean soil and groundwater equivalents: 

### soil: 25 A 0 + 25 A 0.33 + 50 A 0.67 = 41.75 Seq 

### groundwater: 250 A 0 + 250 A 0.33 + 500 A 0.67 = 417.5 Weq 

Then the total contamination at t = end: 

### soil: 10 A 0.67 + 90 A 1 = 96.7 Seq 

### groundwater: 10 A 0.33 + 190 A 0.67 + 800 A 1 = 930.6 Weq 

The actual improvement thus is: 

 soil: 96.7 41.75 = 54.95 Seq 

 groundwater: 930.6 417.5 Seq. = 513.1 Weq 

If the REC-method is applied in situations where one of the remedial options starts after a delay period, the additional soil and groundwater volume that will be contaminated during this delay period must be incorporated in the assessment of the actual improvement of soil quality. 

The prevention of potential soil and groundwater contamination Next to the assessment of the actual improvement of soil and groundwater quality as a result of remedial action it is necessary to evaluate another benefit of remediation or containment: further spread of contamination will be prevented, and thus potential environmental influence is prohibited. Although an ICC option doesn't improve the soil and groundwater quality, it sure has an environmental benefit: the future contamination of soil and groundwater is prevented. 

The soil and groundwater contamination that may occur during the period that no measures are taken can be quantified in two ways: 

1. a rough estimation is made of the groundwater velocity, the retardation of the contamination: this     leads to an estimation of the contamination situation that exists at the end of the regarded time     span; 

2. in a worst-case approach, it is assumed that the total load is distributed over a soil volume, at a level     of > S-value. This resembles the maximum Seq, Weq. 

These two methods will be illustrated with the example given in the previous section. 

ExampleExample Contamination situation t = 0: 

- 100 m 

(^3) contaminated soil: 25 m (^3) > I-value; 25 m (^3) T-I; 50 m (^3) S-T; 

- 1000 m^3 contaminated groundwater: 250 m^3 > I-value; 250 m^3 T-I; 500 m^3 S-T. 


(^2) Note that the percentage applied to calculate the potential benefit differs from the calculation of the actual improvement. Here the aim is to assess the seriousness of the contamination that will occur: every m^3 that will be contaminated above I-level must be counted 100 %, between T-I-level 67 % and so on. Contamination situation t = end if no measures are taken: I based on rough estimation of spreading 110 m^3 contaminated soil: 27 m^3 > I-value; 30 m^3 T-I; 53 m^3 S-T 1200 m^3 contaminated groundwater: 300 m^3 > I-value; 300 m^3 T-I; 600 m^3 S-T II based on distribution contamination on volume, > S-value 500 m^3 contaminated soil S-T 37500 m^3 contaminated groundwater S-T So the total prevention of future pollution can be calculated in Clean soil and groundwater equivalents: 

### I soil: (27-25) A 1 + (30-25) A 0.67 + (53-50) A 0.33 = 6.35 Seq^2 

### groundwater: (300-250) A 1 + (300-250) A 0.67 + (600-500) A 0.33 = 116.5 Weq 

### II soil: (-25) A 1 + (-25) A 0.67 + (500-50) A 0.33 = 106.8 Seq 

### groundwater: (-250) A 1 + (-250) A 0.67 + (37500-500) A 0.33 = 11800 Weq 

As can be concluded from this simple example, the difference in the two methods is very significant. The first method uses site specific information for the assessment of potential spreading, which is somewhat in contradiction with the definition of Environmental merit (being potential environmental influences, independent of the site of the influence). However, the second method is not realistic and would overestimate the total benefit of the environmental influence of remediation. As a result of this, the contribution of the remediation (i.e. the actual clean up) would then be negligible. Therefore, it is suggested to apply the first method to quantify the environmental benefit of prevention of future contamination. 

In spite of the fact that the prevention of future contamination is the same for all remedial alternatives, and as a result of this is not a discriminating factor, it is included in the calculation of Environmental merit. Reason for this is to take the benefit of containment measures into account, which will be reflected in a higher score on Environmental merit. This is especially important for the further development of REC towards a method to compare sites for priority setting. 

Summary For the quantification of the positive outputs for the environment, a distinction is made between 1) the actual improvement of soil quality and 2) the prevention of potential soil contamination. 

1. The actual improvement is quantified by relating the volume of contaminated soil to a quality index.     This procedure expresses the contamination situation in Clean soil and groundwater     equivalents (Seq, Weq). This procedure can be applied before, during and after the     remediation. The environmental benefits of the actual improvement of soil and groundwater quality     can thus be quantified as function of time. 

2. The prevention of potential soil and groundwater contamination expresses the environmental     benefits of the contained situation by estimating the contamination situation that would occur if no     measures were taken during the regarded time span. The increase in contaminated soil and     groundwater is also expressed in clean soil and groundwater equivalents. 

The total environmental benefit for soil and groundwater is the sum of the actual improvement and the prevention of potential contamination. 

4.4.2 Sacrifices for the environment: negative inputs 


- Clean soil     The soil used to fill the excavation pit can also be characterized by two factors, volume and quality.     The expression of Clean soil and groundwater equivalents is also applied here. If clean soil is applied,     the total volume has to be counted to quantify the negative input 'clean soil'. If the soil that is used     to fill the excavation pit contains concentrations above the S-level, the total volume is multiplied by     the %, related to the soil quality. 

- Clean groundwater     It is assumed that all the water that will be extracted is replaced by clean groundwater: so the     extraction uses clean groundwater for flushing. If water is infiltrated during the remediation, only the     nett amount is considered to be used. 

 Vnett withdrawn = Vextraction Vinfiltration 

 Note that the effect of the extraction, i.e. lowering the groundwater table is not evaluated. If the extraction may lead to direct effects for the ecosystem of vegetation, this must be incorporated in the Risk reduction criterium, since it is site specific, and related to a specific object. This is not yet worked out in this phase. 

- Drinking water     If drinking water is used for the infiltration, this is considered to be the use of a scarce commodity.     The total volume must be quantified. 

- Energy     Energy is used in two basic forms: electricity and combustion of fossil fuel (diesel). Since most of the     electricity is produced from fossil fuel, both energy uses are considered to be equally scarce. The total     energy use will be expressed in a normal unit for energy (MJ). The conversion factors for diesel and     kWh are given: 

 1 kg diesel (approx. 1.2 l) = 43 MJ 

 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ 

 Energy consumption, as negative input then can be measured in diesel consumption and kWh consumption. 

- Space     For the operationalization of the aspect space as scarce commodity, the surface occupied in a     specific time period, as a result of the remediation must be quantified in m^2. 

4.4.3 Sacrifices for the environment: negative outputs 

Air emissions The air emissions that are considered to be negative outputs of remediation are caused by the use of energy. The emissions related to the use of 1 litre diesel and 1 kwh will be compared, and a conversion factor for these two types of energy will be established. The total sacrifice for the environment, caused by the use of energy can be expressed in Air-emission equivalents. This will be calculated with the following expression: 

### Air-emission equivalents = Aeq = E Aj /TAj 

in which: Aj is total amount (load) of compound j; TAj is Target-value for compound j = air quality guideline values. 

This expression gives insight in the amount of air that can be affected as a result of the air emissions. In Annexe B, the air emissions related to the use of energy are transformed to Air equivalents: 

 1 MJ electricity = 4.5 Aeq 


1 MJ diesel = 6.7 Aeq 


Water emissions The quantification of water emissions resembles the method presented for Air emissions. The total sacrifice for the environment caused by emissions to the surface water will be expressed in Wateremission equivalents. 

### Water-emission equivalents = Weqsurf = E Wj /TWj 

in which: Wj is total amount (load) of compound j; TWj, surface is Target-value for compound j for surface water. 

The selection of a suitable Target-value is subject for discussion. This expression gives insight in the amount of water that can be affected as a result of the water emissions.

4.5 Integration of the quantified aspectsIntegration of the quantified aspects 

Now the selected aspects are quantified, the aspects need to be integrated, to arrive at a final score for Environmental merit. This integration will consist of the following three steps: 

1. combining aspects that have the same unit: clustering the Seq. and Weq.; 

2. standardizing the different scores, so that they can be added; 

3. weighing of the different scores. 

This last step will only be considered roughly, because for weighing additional research is needed. This can be done in phase 2 of the project. 

4.5.1 Combining soil and groundwater aspects 

The aspects that consider the same compartment will be combined. This means the scores on improved soil quality, prevented additional soil contamination (both environmental benefits) and the use of clean soil (an environmental sacrifice) will be combined into one score. Since the environmental merit calculation is not-object oriented there is no need for weighing the aspect differently: all soil used is evaluated the same, independent of its location. The sum is expressed in the following formula: 

 Seqtot = Seq 1 + Seq 2 Seq 3 

in which: Seq 1 is improved soil quality (in Seq's); Seq 2 is prevented additional soil contamination (in Seq's); Seq 3 is used clean soil (Seq's). 


The same procedure is followed for the aspects concerning groundwater: improved groundwater quality, prevented additional groundwater contamination (both environmental benefits) and the use of clean groundwater (an environmental sacrifice). 

 Weqtot = Weq 1 + Weq 2 Weq 3 

in which: Weq 1 is improved groundwater quality (in Weq's); Weq 2 is prevented additional groundwater contamination (in Weq's); Weq 3 is used clean groundwater (Weq's). 

4.5.2 Standardization of the different (combined) aspects 

After this combining of aspects there remain seven quantified aspects: 

1. total soil equivalents (Seqtot); 

2. total groundwater equivalents (Weqtot); 

3. drinking water (m^3 ); 

4. energy (MJ); 

5. space (m^2 ); 

6. air equivalents (Aeq); 

7. surface water equivalents (Weqsurface). 

The first two combined scores on soil and groundwater are likely to be benefits for the environment, all the other scores are environmental sacrifices. Before integration of the seven aspects is possible, the scores on the separate (7) aspects must be standardized. In this way, the absolute scores are related to a scale that is derived from a general concept. If this general concept is applied on all the aspects, the standardized scores are comparable. 

A general concept for standardization of different scores is defining a minimum and maximum value for a specific aspect. Comparing the actual score on a specific aspect with two extremes, positions the score in relation to the most desirable outcome and the less desirable outcome of the aspect. The relation between the score on a specific aspect and its standardized value is assumed to be linear to the distance from both points. If for aspect Y the minimum score (Y = 0) -1000 and the maximum score (Y = 00) 6000, than for every score, Y can be derived from the linear relation (see fig. 4.3). 


Fig. 4.3. R e l a t i o n between 'minimum' and 'maximum' score for a specific aspect, and the normalized value for this aspect. 

Now we have to define to the 'minimum' and 'maximum' score for all the seven quantified aspects. It is necessary to define a hypothetical minimum and maximum for the selected aspects. This will be derived according to a standard approach. For the determination of minimum and maximum values for the aspects, the most desirable and most undesirable situation for this contamination will be calculated by the standard approach, that is described in Annexe C. This leads to a minimum and maximum score for all the aspects. The minimum and maximum scores are related to a standardized score of 0 respectively 100. 

4.5.3 Weighing of the different aspects 

Before the final integration of the different aspects is possible a weighing can take place. Weighing of the different aspects can be done several ways, for example by: scientific research, policy priorities, expert guess or opinion research. At this moment there is no research available that covers the weighing of the selected aspects. Therefore in this phase of the development of the REC-method the different standardized scores are simply combined without weighing. Of course it is possible for the user to, within boundaries, add personal weighing. This leads to the following formula: 

 Environmental merit = TEIi,positive aspects TEIi, negative aspects 

### = (Ws A Y 1 ) + (Ww A Y 2 ) (Wd A Y 3 ) (We A Y 4 ) (Wsp A Y 5 ) (Wa A Y 6 ) (Wsurf A Y 7 ) 

in which: Ws is weight factor, soil; Ww is weight factor, groundwater; Wd is weight factor, drinking water; We is weight factor, energy; Wsp is weight factor, space; Wa is weight factor, air emissions; Wsur is weight factor, emissions to surface water; Y 1 is standardized score, gained soil equivalents; Y 2 is standardized score, gained groundwater equivalents; Y 3 is standardized score, drinking water use; Y 4 is standardized score, energy use; Y 5 is standardized score, space occupation; Y 6 is standardized score, air emissions; Y 7 is standardized score, emissions to surface water.

### COSTSCOSTS 

5.1 SummarySummary 

In this chapter, a first description of the criterium Costs is presented. Costs refer to the expenses related to remedial activities as well as the changes in asset value that may be the result of increased possibilities in use of the property. Expenses cover as the direct as well as the indirect expenses (i.e. related to the remediation) and indirect expenses. A distinction will be made between foundation expenses at the beginning of the remedial activities, the replacement expenses and the continuous (operating) expenses. To include the time value of money into the assessment of the total costs, it will be necessary to calculate the Nett Present Value of all future expenses. The quantification of the change in asset value will be based on a combination of factors, such as the possibilities for use of the site, the current use, the market demand, prices, etc. This has not yet been worked out in phase 1. 

5.2 Definition and contextDefinition and context 

In this paragraph, the definition and general expression of costs will be elaborated, as well as the existing practise for cost estimation in the Netherlands. 

5.2.1 Definition and general expression of Costs 

The building blocks for the Cost criterium are the FinancialFinancial expensesexpenses directly or indirectly related to the remedial action. Besides this, CChangeshanges inin thethe valuevalue ofof assetsassets will be considered as costs. Both aspects will be expressed in monetary terms and need not to be normalized. In chapter 2, Financial expenses and Change in value were expressed as:

in which: F is Financial expenses; V is change in Value; cash flow is amount of money paid for investments and operating costs; asset increase is change in value of asset by remediation; or decrease i is remediation alternative i; t is time. 

CostsCosts refers to the sum of expenses and changes in value, whereby, the change in the value of assets will (in most cases) be positive (i.e. a negative cost factor!). 

 CostsCosts = TFi(positive sign) + TVi(negative sign) (9) 

The driving force for optimizing remediation alternatives is minimizing costs by minimizing the financial expenses and maximizing the increase of value of assets. 


5.2.2 Common practise on cost estimationCommon practise on cost estimation 

Financial expenses As was discussed in paragraph 2.3.1, it is common practise to compare the costs of remediation alternatives, based on the Nett Present Value. A simplified calculation method is described by the ministry of VROM. The nett interest rate that is applied in these calculations is set by the Minister of finance, once every year. However, by calculating the Nett Present Value of financial expenses during the remediation period the following problems arise: 

1. The party that has to pay for the remediation often prefers a cash flow that is more or less stabilized     in time. Big fluctuations in expenses over the years result in a major impact on the profit and loss     account of a company, and are therefore unfavourable. 

2. By calculating with the interest rate set by the minister, the opportunity costs of money are     evaluated from the opportunity to put the money in the bank. However, companies do evaluate     investments on their internal rate of return: the opportunity costs of money are therefore significantly     higher. If one calculates with a higher interest rate, alternatives that shift costs to the future (or     spread these costs in time) are stronger favoured than by calculating with a lower interest rate. 

3. The fixed interest rate is based on the interest that is expected to be realistic for short term     investments (bank account) and a mean inflation rate, based on the general consumption pattern.     However, the general inflation is not relevant, but the specific price developments of expenses for     remediation (labour, capital goods). Since the calculated Nett Present Value is very sensitive for the     selected interest rate, this aspect needs more consideration. 

Changes in value of assets Until now, the possibility of increased value of assets is not considered in the general cost estimation. In case of abandoning or hand over of a site, the total potential remediation costs are estimated (meaning the total, discounted financial expenses) and subtracted from the total value of the property. Based on this practise, one could conclude, that remediation doesn't lead to an increase in asset-value. However, it is accepted generally, that the value of the property is determined by the possible use of the site. This use is, among other things, determined by the soil quality and the restrictions related to remedial measures. Based on the evaluation of transactions of properties on contaminated sites, it is not clear until now what impact soil contamination has on the value of the assets or on the transaction speed. Another aspect to be considered in the estimation of changes in asset vales is the interdependence between asset value and 'future remediation costs'. Part of the impact of soil contamination on the value of land is based on the assumption that remedial actions will be costly and necessary in the future. A devaluation of the property thus can be seen as a reservation for future expenses. If a significant reduction of remedial expenses will be achieved by new strategies like extensive remediation, than the impact on asset value is also expected to decrease. However, part of the 'psychological devaluation' is expected to remain relevant. This aspect needs further elaboration in phase 2 of the REC-project. 

5.3 Identification of relevant aspects for CostsIdentification of relevant aspects for Costs 5.3.1 Financial expenses 

The financial expenses related to a remediation can be divided in direct and indirect expenses. Direct expenses have to be made for the realisation of the remediation itself, and lead directly to the remediation goal. Indirect expenses are expenses that are prerequisite for remediation or the side effect of the remedial activities. The indirect expenses do not contribute directly to the remediation goal. An overview of direct and indirect expenses that can be discerned is given in table 5.1. 

Table 5.1. Financial expenses of a remediation. 

 direct expenses indirect expenses 


- soil and sludge: costs for excavation, separation, tempo-     rary storage, transport, disposal, cleaning and re-use 

- roundwater: costs for withdrawal and cleaning 

- isolation measures: costs for installation 

- costs for management and environmental supervision of     the remediation 

- costs for maintenance of remedial facilities 

- aftercare (for isolation option and temporary measures),     including monitoring 

- replacement (for isolation and withdrawal facilities) 

- overhead costs 

- investigation and planning costs 

- fees and costs of procedures and permits 

- costs of demolition and restoration 

- civil-technical costs 

- costs due to usage restrictions (capital and production     losses) 

- compensation to third parties 

- protection costs 

- costs due to "nuisance and rigmarole" 

5.3.2 Change in value of the assets 

To evaluate the change in the value of the assets, the following aspects are considered to be relevant: 

1. possibilities for soil use before, during and after the remediation (what scenario's are allowed:     industry, residential area, agriculture, natural reserve, recreational area, etc.; 

2. current use of site, and the immediate surroundings; 

3. market demand for specific site use in the area; 

4. current prices per m^2 for non-contaminated sites; 

5. current prices per m^2 for contaminated sites (if available). 

5.4 Operationalization of selected aspectsOperationalization of selected aspects 

Financial expenses The listed costs aspects are generally well quantifiable. However, some have an once-only character while others are recurrent. Furthermore, the moment of payment of the various aspects may vary widely. In order to be able to compare such sets of costs, it is necessary to recalculate them to a single investment (Nett Present Value) to be made at the start of the project. 

In principle, three types of costs can be discerned: 

1. foundation costs: single investments that are made at the start of the remediation; 

2. continuous costs: recurrent costs for rent, maintenance, cleaning, etc; 

3. replacement costs: costs for replacement of (large parts of) installations, at a later date. 

These types of costs can be divided into one or more single investments at certain moments and continuous investments during certain periods. 


Assuming an effective interest (interest on state obligations minus inflation rate and including an eventual risk surcharge for companies and for lower governments) of i %, the following formulas can be given: 

single investments:single investments: 

 investment NPV = ---------------(1 + i)n 

in which: n is years between now and investment. 

continuous investments (in case if infinite series of years):continuous investments (in case if infinite series of years): 

### NPV = continuous yearly investment A 1/i 

Besides this method for calculation of the nett present value, which is a first approximation, only applicable under the assumption of a fixed difference between interest and inflation, other methods for capitalization will be applied. 

### investment A (1 + a)n 

#### NPV = ------------------------------

 (1 + b)n 

in which: a is increase of specific prices; b is interest rate (opportunity investment rate). 

By applying this method in the REC-assessment, it is possible to investigate the sensitivity of the total Costs for assumptions on interest and price developments. 

For almost all the costs mentioned, default values per unit will be incorporated in the REC-assessment procedure. Default values are available for soil and water treatment, groundwater withdrawal, transport, etc. These default values are based on current market prices as are available at Tauw Milieu bv. 

Changes in asset value The operationalization of the changes in asset value will be worked out in phase 2 of the REC-project. 

5.5 Integration of the quantified aspectsIntegration of the quantified aspects 

Since all the expenses (and later on the changes in asset value) will be expressed in monetary terms, the integration of the separate aspects is a simple adding of amounts of money (all expressed in Nett present values).

### ILLUSTRATING EXAMPLEILLUSTRATING EXAMPLE 

6.1 SummarySummary 

In this chapter an illustrating example is described. The example concerns a parcel with a house situated in a city area with a contamination from spilling around a former gas oil filling point of xylenes and benzene. The following four options are considered in the assessment: 

Option I: Excavation and treatment of the contaminated soil and withdrawal and treatment of the contaminated groundwater. Option II: Combination of soil air extraction treatment in the contaminated soil and above the contaminated groundwater. Option III: Extensive (intrinsic) in situ bioremediation with intermitting soil vapour extraction and minimized groundwater withdrawal. Option IV: Geohydrological containment of contamination combined with safety measures. 

All these options start at t = 0 and the applicable time span is 30 years. 

In the calculation of the risk reduction all exposed objects are defined (adults, workers, children and local ecosystem) with their exposure scenarios. For the different options the risk reduction is calculated. Their is a sensitivity check for the used time spane. In this situation the time span doesn't influence the final result much, because the risk is reduced for all options significantly after the start of the remediation. 

In the calculation of environmental merit the identification of relevant aspects is done. Only the use of drinkwater has no relevance in all the options. The scores on the other aspect are calculated. For the standarization of the different aspects a default situation is used to calculate minimum and maximum scores for each aspect. 

For the calculation of the costs a rough estimation is made. The annual cost are discounted with a nett intrest of 5 %. The results of the calculations are summarized in table 6.1.

6.2 Outline of the chapterOutline of the chapter 

In order to be able to clarify the proposed methods for the elaboration and quantification of the RECprocedure, an example has been defined and worked out in this chapter. Paragraph 6.3 describes the location, for which four remedial options are generated. Based on this, the risk reduction (6.5), environmental merit (6.6), and cost (6.7) are quantified, after which a comparison of the alternatives can take place in step (6.8). 


6.3 Description of the locationDescription of the location 

The location of the example concerns a parcel with a house (total area 250 m^2 ), situated in a city area. At the parcel, spilling around a former gas oil filling point has led to soil contamination. The contamination has spread via the groundwater but has not crossed the parcel boundaries yet. Therefore, risks for exposure to contaminants at this moment are limited to the parcel. The situation is sketched in figure 6.1. In table 6.2 some information on the contamination situation is presented.

6.4 Generation and elaboration of remedial optionsGeneration and elaboration of remedial options 

Previous to the elaboration of applicable remedial options, a quick estimate of the amount of risk-redu ction, environmental contribution and related costs of a number of possible remedial options is made. Based on this estimate, the following four remedial options have been selected as feasible: 

Option I: Excavation and treatment of the contaminated soil and withdrawal and treatment of the contaminated groundwater. Option II: Combination of soil air extraction/treatment both in the contaminated soil and above the contaminated groundwater, with compressed air injection below the contaminated groundwater. Option III: Extensive (intrinsic) in situ bioremediation with intermitting soil vapour extraction and minimized groundwater withdrawal. Option IV: Geohydrological containment of contamination combined with safety measures. 

The four options are discussed in more detail in the following sections. 


6.4.1 Option I 

The remediation starts at t = 0. 

The contaminated soil is excavated. The excavation takes place without lowering the groundwater table. The applied remediation threshold is the S-value. For technical reasons, a 1 : 1 talus is applied. The total excavated volume is 50 m^3 , of which 24 m^3 is contaminated and 26 m^3 non-contaminated. The excavation of the contaminated soil will take 2 days and takes 4 workers. The contaminated soil is cleaned in a thermal treatment plant. This plant is situated at 50 km of the site. Clean soil is transported to the site over 25 km to fill the excavation pit. 

The contaminated groundwater is withdrawn by means of a series of withdrawal wells. The applied 

### remediation threshold is the S-value, the end concentrations in the groundwater will be approx. 1 : g/L. 

The required withdrawal discharge is 5 m^3 /hour. The required withdrawal period is 1,5 years. The discharged water is treated by means of air stripping. The stripped aromatics are adsorbed on active carbon. The treated water will be discharged to the surface water. 

6.4.2 Option II 

The remediation starts at t = 0. 

The contaminated soil is cleaned by means of soil gas vapour extraction. The applied remediation threshold is the S-value. The contaminated groundwater is cleaned by means of a combination of compressed air injection below the groundwater contamination and soil gas extraction in the unsaturated zone above it. The extracted soil gas is treated by means of active carbon. The required extraction period is 2 years. At this moment the remaining concentrations lie between Sand T-value 

### (i.e. approximately 10 : g/L). 

In order to avoid further spreading of contaminated groundwater, a groundwater catchment well is installed downstream of the contamination, extracting 3 m^3 /h. The withdrawn groundwater is expected to be thus contaminated that it does not require treatment previous to discharge to the surface water. 

6.4.3 Option III 

The remediation starts at t = 0. 

The contaminated soil is treated by means of extensive bioremediation: the intrinsic capacity for biodegradation is used and optimized by minimal stimulation. Soil vapour is extracted intermittently, for supplying oxygen, thereby lowering the volatilization. The applied remediation threshold is the Svalue. 

The groundwater is contained by minimal, intermitted extraction (1 day a week, 2 m^3 /h). The withdrawn groundwater is expected to be thus contaminated that it does not require treatment previous to discharge into the sewer system. The extracted soil gas is treated by means of active carbon. The required extraction period is 10 years. At that moment the remaining concentrations lie 

### between Sand T-value (i.e. approximately 10 : g/L). 


6.4.4 Option IV 

The site is not remediated. By temporary measures the actual exposure at the site is lowered to an acceptable level for people, i.e. the RIndex for the population is maintained equal to 1 for the total applicable time span. The spreading of contaminated groundwater is prevented by a groundwater containment system, extracting 3 m^3 /h continuously. The withdrawn water can be discharged into the sewer system. 

6.5 Risk reductionRisk reduction 6.5.1 Identification of threatened objects 

According to the described method in the main text, the first step is to identify the threatened objects, by following the decision schemes in paragraph 3.3: 

1. There are humans in the system and there are relevant subpopulations (children). The exposure of     adults and children will be assessed separately. 

2. There are workers exposed to soil contamination and it is assumed that the exposure is not fully     countered by protection. The exposure to workers will be quantified. 

3. The ecosystem in the system is relevant, but cannot be specified. Therefore exposure to a standard     ecosystem will be evaluated. 

All options start at the same time (say t = 0). Therefore no objects outside the parcel are expected to be exposed in the future. 

The applicable time span for this case is 30 years. 

6.5.2 Definition of exposure scenario 

For the threatened objects identified, a site specific exposure scenario is defined. In this case, the main focus is on inhalation of indoor air, which is the most important exposure route for volatile compounds. In table 6.3 the relevant data for exposure are summarized. 

6.5.3 Quantification of risk reduction 

Quantification for the reference situation R0 To calculate risk reduction for remedial alternatives, it is necessary to compare it with a reference situation. As reference situation, the existing situation has been chosen, assuming that it will remain the same during the standard time span of 30 years (see section 3.5). 

People in the housePeople in the house Based on the defined exposure scenario's and the contamination situation as listed in table 6.2, and applying the volatilization modules from the CSOIL model, the contamination leads to exceedence of TDI for children (1) and adults (2) with a factor of: 

- children:^ xylenes 6.5 x TDI, benzene 6.7 x TDI (mainly via air); 

- adults: xylenes 4 x TDI, benzene 4 x TDI (mainly via air).

EcosystemEcosystem Given the available HC 50 for benzene at 15 mg/kg dm, and given the general form of the HC-curves (see fig. 6.2), it can be calculated from table D1 in Annexe D that, 76 % of the species is expected to be at risk. 

Quantification of the exposure at t = 0 (based on risk determining component: benzene) With the following quantification, it is assumed that the influence on the ecosystem is limited to the soil contamination. All the separate criteria for risk are weighted the same: Wp = We = ... = Ww = 1. The results of the quantification are listed in table 6.4.

Quantification for all remedial options (risks during execution of the remediatio n) Option IOption I humans The total exposure of the people in the house exists of the exposure during excavation (2 days) and the exposure during the groundwater remediation (1.5 year). The exposure during the excavation is assumed to be negligible given the short exposure time, compared to the groundwater remediation. Due to the expected form of the xylenes concentration curve in the groundwater (and thus in the soil gas) during the remedial works, the average concentration during the remediation is estimated at about 

### 1/4 of the initial concentration (see fig. 6.3), hence 1200 : g of xylenes/L, and 500 : g of benzene/L. 


workers Given the contaminant concentrations encountered in the soil and assuming that the contaminant concentration in the excavation pit air will be about 10 % of the equilibrium concentration, pit air concentrations of 1300 mg/m^3 xylenes and 260 mg/m^3 benzene can be calculated. These concentrations exceed the MAC-value by about a factor 4 and 9 respectively. At these concentrations, personal protection equipment is required. It is assumed that this equipment provides 90 % protection. Thus for benzene exposure at 10 % of the outdoor concentration (or 10 % of the time exposure at outdoor level) occurs. 

Fig. 6.3. Course of contamination during groundwater remediation. 

ecosystem The mean concentration during remediation of the groundwater is estimated at 1/4 of the initial concentration. At this concentration it is expected that 43 % of the species is protected. The surface area, affecting the ecosystem is decreased by excavation from 141 m^2 to 125 m^2. The excavation itself is assumed to be of no influence, because of the relatively small surface area affected. In table 6.5, the results of the calculations are summarized.

Option IIOption II humans Since almost all exposure occurs as a result of inhalation of indoor air, it is expected that the actual evaporation of volatile compounds is prevented by the soil vapour extraction system. As a result of this, no exposure of people in the house takes place. 

workers In this option, the exposure of workers involved in the remediation to the contamination is assumed to be negligible. 

ecosystem Due to the expected form of the xylenes and benzene concentration curve in the soil, groundwater and soil vapour during the remedial works, the average concentration during the remediation is estimated at about 1/3 of the initial concentration. For the ecosystem this is estimated to result in an average protection of the ecosystem of 50 % for benzene. 

In table 6.6, the results of the calculations are summarized.

### 10 % of the existing concentration of 1200 : g/L for xylenes and 500 : g/L for benzene. This results in 

a RIndex for children of 0.17, and for adults 0.10 times the TDI. 

workers In this option, the exposure of workers involved in the remediation to the contamination is assumed to be negligible.

Option IVOption IV Since the option is containment of the contamination, the site is not remediated. The time period 'during remediation' is (except for the installation of containment measures) negligible. The remaining risk after installation, thus during the actual contained situation is quantified in 'risk after remediation' in the following section. 

Quantification of the exposure after the remediation 

Option IOption I Due to the applied remediation thresholds the remaining risk after finishing remedial measures is expected to be very low. It is assumed that the remaining concentration of aromatic compounds will 

### be approx. 1 : g/L. At this concentration the following risk levels can be quantified: 

### 1 : g/L: 

- children: (benzene) 0.002 TDI; 

- adults: (benzene) 0.001 TDI; 

- ecosystem: < 0.1 % species at risk. 

The total time to evaluate after remediation is 30 remediation time. 

The calculation of the risk scores after execution of the remedial options I is summarized in table 6.8.

Option I: 17.08 0.27 0.004 = 16.81 (98.40 %); Option II: 17.08 0.001 0.042 = 17.04 (99.75 %); Option III: 17.08 0.16 0.03 = 16.89 (98.91 %); Option IV: 17.08 0 4.27 = 12.80 (74.94 %). 

Influence of total time period To find out if the outcome of the calculation of risk reduction is very sensitive for the chosen time period of 30 years, the calculations are executed for a time period of 10 resp. 70 years. The results of these calculations are shown in table 6.12. 

From this example, it can be concluded that the time span regarded in the calculation of risk reduction doesn't influence the final result much; the most important impact can be expected on contributions to the total exposure that occur in a relatively short time period (such as the excavation and/or remediation time. 

One's first impression on the results for the risk reduction could be, that the method is not discriminating between the four different alternatives. Only the Containment option (IV) does show a number significant deviating from the other options. The similarity of the three other options is mainly caused by its aspect of time: all three remedial options were started at t = 0. Besides, all three options in the example are rapidly decreasing actual exposure to an acceptable level. When a remediation is postponed, the risk reduction can easily become less pronounced. The method will be more discriminating in case options involve a larger number of remedial workers that work a longer period of time. It may be concluded that the similarly of the outcome for the example is in agreement with presuppositions, and that more variation in aspect of time and number of persons involved will give a larger discrimination between remedial alternatives.

6.6 Environmental meritEnvironmental merit 

For the determination of Environmental merit, the situation before, during and after the remediation has to be quantified. Since all the options start at t = 0, the environmental influences before remediation are 

0. The environmental influences during remediation will be assessed in the following sections (6.6.1 to 6.6.3). The environmental influences after the remediation is executed, exist of the improved soil and groundwater quality and the prevented future contamination. This is taken into account in the operationalization (6.6.2). Environmental merit will be determined for the 4 options in 6.6.3. 

6.6.1 Identification of relevant aspects 

First, it is necessary to describe the remedial options in terms of environmental influences. Table 6.13 gives an overview for the four remedial options described in 6.4. 

6.6.2 Operationalization environmental influences 

Now the identified aspects will be operationalized, according to the described method in chapter 4.

Option I 

Benefits for the environmentBenefits for the environment actual improvement The soil quality is improved by excavation and replacement with clean soil. This has to be expressed in Soil quality equivalents. In the initial situation, 24 m^3 soil is contaminated, from which 10 m^3 above I-level and 14 m^3 above T

### level. In Seq this is 10 A 1 + 14 A 0.67 = 19.38 Seq. The final situation contains no contaminated soil, 

so the actual improvement = 19.38 Seq. 

The groundwater quality is improved by groundwater remediation. In the initial situation, 313 m^3 groundwater is contaminated, from which 100 m^3 above I-level, 150 above T-level and 63 m^3 above 

### S-level. In Weq this is 100 A 1 + 150 A 0.67 + 63 A 0.33 = 221 Weq. In the final situation, all the 

contamination is removed, so the actual improvement = 221 Weq. 

prevented future contamination It is estimated that at the end of the regarded time span, the soil contamination is increased to 30 m^3 (12 m^3 > I, 18 m^3 T), and the groundwater contamination to 500 m^3 (150 m^3 > I, 200 m^3 > T, 150 m^3 > S). 

The total prevented future contamination will be expressed in Seq en Weq: 

### soil: (12-10) A 1 + (18-14) A 0.67 = 4.68 Seq 

### groundwater: (150-100) A 1 + (200-150) A 0.67 + (150-63) A 0.33 = 112 Weq 

The total benefits for the environment in option 1 are thus: 

 soil: 19.38 + 4.68 = 24.1 Seq 

 groundwater: 221 + 112 = 333 Weq 


Sacrifices for the environment: negative inputsSacrifices for the environment: negative inputs clean soil In option I, 24 m^3 clean soil is used to fill the excavation pit. The input equals 24 Seq. However, it must be taken into account that the excavated soil will be treated, and therefore will again be available for use. If the quality of the treated soil equals the quality of the soil used to fill the excavation pit, the nett input of clean soil in the remediation is 0. The transportation and treatment of the soil will of course be considered at 'energy' and 'air quality'. Since the soil is treated in a thermal treatment plant, it is assumed that the total volume (minus the organic matter content) will be available after treatment. Then only 0.5 m^3 additional soil will be used in this option: 0.5 Seq. 

clean groundwater In option I, 1 m^3 /h will be withdrawn for 1,5 year. The total amount of groundwater equals 13.140 m^3 , (= Weq). 

energy The energy consumption of the alternative exists of energy for excavation, transport of contaminated and clean soil, treatment of the soil, treatment of the groundwater and groundwater withdrawal.

Sacrifices for the environment: negative outputsSacrifices for the environment: negative outputs air quality A distinction must be made between the use of electricity and diesel for energy consumption. It is assumed, that diesel is used for the excavation, transport and treatment of the soil, and electricity for the other items: 

### diesel: 28000 MJ A 6.7 Aeq/MJdiesel = 188000 Aeq 

### electricity: 2500 MJ A 4.5 Aeq/MJelectricity = 11250 Aeq 

Total sacrifice on air quality = 200000 Aeq. 

water quality It is assumed that the extracted water is treated until the demand of the license if met. The remaining concentration in the water is ten times above the Surface water quality guideline. 

### In Weq this leads to 13140 m^3 A 10 = 131400 Weq. 


Option II 

Benefits for the environmentBenefits for the environment actual improvement The soil quality is improved by intensive in situ remediation. This has to be expressed in Soil quality equivalents. In the initial situation, 24 m^3 soil is contaminated, from which 10 m^3 above I-level and 14 m^3 above T

soil (10 m^3 < T-level = 3.33 Seq), so the actual improvement = 16.05 Seq. 

The groundwater quality is improved by in situ remediation. In the initial situation, 313 m^3 groundwater is contaminated, from which 100 m^3 above I-level, 150 above T-level and 63 m^3 above S-level. In Weq 

### this is 100 A 1 + 150 A 0.67 + 63 A 0.33 = 221 Weq. In the final situation, the remaining contamination 

equals 100 m^3 < T-value (= 33 Weq), so the actual improvement = 188 Weq. 

prevented future contamination It is estimated that at the end of the regarded time span, the soil contamination is increased to 30 m^3 (12 m^3 > I, 18 m^3 > T), and the groundwater contamination to 500 m^3 (150 m^3 > I, 200 m^3 > T, 150 m^3 > S). 

The total prevented future contamination will be expressed in Seq en Weq: 

### soil: (12-10) A 1 + (18-14) A 0.67 = 4.68 Seq 

### groundwater: (150-100) A 1 + (200-150) A 0.67 + (150-63) A 0.33 = 112 Weq

The initial situation is 19.38 Seq. The final situation contains remaining contaminated soil (10 m^3 < Tlevel = 3.33 Seq), so the actual improvement = 16.05 Seq. 

The groundwater quality is improved by in situ remediation. The initial situation = 221 Weq. In the final situation, the remaining contamination equals 100 m^3 < T-value (= 33 Weq), so the actual improvement = 188 Weq.

 soil: 16.05 + 4.68 = 20.73 Seq 

 groundwater: 188 + 112 = 300 Weq 

(Note that the same benefits are achieved as in option II, but in a different time span).

The data represented in table 6.14 are quantified for the total remediation period. The total Environmental merit is a function of time, in which the environmental merit fore, during and after the remediation are taken into account. However, in this case, all the options start at t = 0, therefore Environmental merit before remediation is 0. It is assumed that the environmental influences after remediation are negligible (no spreading of remaining concentrations) which results in a score on Environmental merit after remediation of 0. Therefore, it is possible to standardize the scores in table 6.14. 

6.6.3 Standardization of environmental influences 

The first step in the standardization of the environmental influences exists of the combination of the soil and groundwater aspects into an integrated score. Then the two extremes, least desirable and most desirable will be calculated for this situation (see Annexe C). The results of this calculation are presented in table 6.15.

### FLOW CHARTS FOR APPLYING THE REC-METHODFLOW CHARTS FOR APPLYING THE REC-METHOD 

7.1 General description of flow chartsGeneral description of flow charts 

In this chapter, the application of the REC-method is described in three flow charts. In these flow charts, the activities that need to be executed to arrive at the R, E and C score are schematically described, and the necessary input documents and tools are defined. This gives a general overview of the activities: a more detailed break-down of all the detailed input data will be worked out during the application of the REC-method on real cases in phase 2. 

Three symbols are used in the flow charts, that are explained in figure 7.1. 

Fig. 7.1. Symbols used in flow charts REC-method. 

In the following sections the flow charts of the three criteria will be presented and discussed. 

7.2 Flow chart Risk reductionFlow chart Risk reduction 

Figure 7.2 represents the activities and inputs needed to arrive at an integrated score on Risk reduction. 

The first activity is the selection of the type and number of relevant objects for the site. To do this, one needs information about the location (lay out of the site, the contamination situation in relation to the exposure media such as superficial soil concentrations, indoor air, etc.) and about the remedial alternatives. Based on the time span that must be regarded, the system area can be assessed. 

The second activity exists of the calculation of Risk Indices for the selected objects. To do this, we need to define a representative exposure scenario and translate the existing contamination situation to exposure of humans and the ecosystem. Exposure models may be a usefull tool in this step, besides the measurements of direct contact media. 

Based on the separate Risk Indices, an integrated score for the existing situation at t = 0 can be established in activity 3. 


F i g . 7.2 . F l o w c h art for the assessment of Risk reduction. 


For the fourth and fifth activity, one needs information about the expected exposure of objects during and after the remediation. In case the exposure is totally intercepted (by means of isolation measures, complete soil vapour extraction, and so on) the Risk index for these alternatives will be 0. For all other alternatives, that result in a (slow) decrease of exposure, an estimation of the exposure during the decrease of the contamination must be made. Information about the number of remedial workers, their residence time on the site, and the effectivity of safety measures must be included in the calculation of Risk indices. 

The total Risk index is calculated by adding up the separate indices in the sixth activity. 

Finally, Risk reduction is calculated by subtracting the calculated total risk for a specific remediation alternative from the calculated Total risk based on exposure at t = 0. 

7.3. Flow chart Environmental meritFlow chart Environmental merit 

In figure 7.3 the flow chart for the determination of Environmental merit is presented. 

The first activity is the estimation of the concentration in soil and groundwater before remediation, during and after remediation and the expected spreading that would occur if no measures were taken. This activity is based on the information already available from the remedial investigation plan, and on rough estimates based on data from the location. 

The second activity is to express the soiland groundwaterquality improvement and the prevention of future contamination in clean Soil and groundWater equivalents, by means of comparing the actual concentrations with quality standards. 

From the remedial investigation plan, a lot of data must be extracted to establish the Water use (Seq), Surface water emissions (Weqsurf ), Clean soil use (Seq), space, Air emissions and energy use. For the last two, conversion factors will be necessary to arrive at the Air equivalents and MJ. 

The third activity is to combine all the data on clean soil equivalents and clean groundwater equivalents into integrated scores. 

The fourth activity is to define the minimum and maximum scores for the different aspects by defining the most desirable and most undesirable situation for the specific site. 

In the fifth step, the actual score on a specific aspect can be related to the defined minimum and maximum. 

Finally, the separate normalized scores are integrated by (weighed) addition.

7.4 Flow chart CostsFlow chart Costs 

In figure 7.4 the flow chart for the assessment of Costs is presented. First, the expenses for the remediation will be quantified as a function of time, based on the information in the remedial investigation plan. Than the costs are all transformed into expenses for year 1 by applying the theory of discounting. The Nett Present Value will be determined according to a specific method, using selected interest and inflation numbers. The Changes in asset value will be quantified (if possible) by valuation of the property and assets and comparing the value with similar, non contaminated sites. Historical and current transaction prices, and the impact on contamination on the transaction speed may be estimated. If possible, the total costs of the contamination, in terms of changes in value will be established and transformed by applying discounting. Finally, the total Costs are calculated by adding the Nett Present Value of the expenses and the Nett present Value of the asset Value change.

### CO = 1.1 A 10 -5^ kg 

For diesel the following air emissions (a MJ) are identified by using simpro 3.0 (which is based on the LCA-method): 

Dust 

### = 9.4 A 10 -5^ kg 

### SO 2 = 9.4 A 10 -5^ kg 

### NOx = 1.2 A 10 -3^ kg 

### CO 2 = 7.6 A 10 -2^ kg 

### Cx Hy = 2.3 A 10 -4^ kg 

### Naphthalene = 3.8 A 10 -7^ kg 

### Phenanthrene = 3.8 A 10 -8^ kg 

### Chryseen = 2.5 A 10 -9^ kg 

It is difficult to relate the different air emissions to each other, because of the lack of target-values. There are emission-reduction targets in the Dutch policy, but they relate to the total amount of emission. Although there are no target-values, it is possible to relate the emission to maximum allowable emission per m^3. These values are available for the following substances: 

SO 2 = 200 mg/m 

 3 0 

NOx = 200 mg/m^30 HF = 5.0 mg/m^30 F = 5.0 mg/m^30 Hg = 0.2 mg/m^30 Cd = 0.2 mg/m^30 Naphthalene = 50 mg/m^30 

The values relate approximately to standard concentration in the air for the several substances as about 1 : 1000. Assuming that this relation can be applied on the other substances too, we can develop maximum allowable emissions per m^3 for the other substances. The actual concentrations for CO 2 , CO and Cx Hy are respectively 360 ppm, 25 ppm and 2.2 ppm. For Phenanthrene and Chryseen the same targetvalue is used as for naphthalene. 


This leads to the following intervention-values: 

CO 2 

### . 700 g/m^30 

### CO. 30 g/m^30 

### Cx Hy. 1 g/m^30 

### Phenanthrene. 50 mg/m^30 

### Chryseen. 50 mg/m^30 

Now it is possible to calculate the different standard Aeq's for electricity and diesel. For example the Aeq for CO 2 in diesel is 76/700 = 0.11. When all the scores are combined this leads to: 4.5 Aeq a MJ electricity and 6.7 Aeq a MJ diesel.

### DEFAULT CALCULATION FOR STANDARDIZATIONDEFAULT CALCULATION FOR STANDARDIZATION 

### ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCESENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES 

In this annexe, a default situation for soil remediation is defined. This default situation is used to determine the difference between the desired and undesired situation. This is worked out for every aspect separately, to define the 'value function' for the standardization of the aspects. Underlying assumption in this approach is that it makes no difference what aspect is minimized or maximized. The over all aim is to minimize the negative aspects and maximize the positive aspects. The value-function is assumed to be linear. So the following remediation of the default situation is evaluated as equal: 

I. Seq = 50 % maximum Seq. + Weq = 100% maximum Weq = 150 

II. Seq = 100 % maximum Seq. + Weq = 50 % maximum Weq = 150 

The default situation is used to derive the equations that express the standardization of the aspects. For the illustration of the default situation the example of chapter 6 is used 

Soil and groundwaterSoil and groundwater 

Most desirable scenario Default situation: after remediation there is no contamination left and there is no clean soil or groundwater used. 

The following calculation will be made: 

In the initial situation, 24 m^3 soil is contaminated, from which 10 m^3 above I-level and 14 m^3 above T

### level. In Seq this is 10 A 1 + 14 A 0.67 = 19.38 Seq. The final situation contains no contaminated soil, 

so the actual improvement = 19.38 Seq. 

The groundwater quality is improved by groundwater remediation. In the initial situation, 313 m^3 groundwater is contaminated, from which 100 m^3 above I-level, 150 above T-level and 63 m^3 above 

### S-level. In Weq this is 100 A 1 + 150 A 0.67 + 63 A 0.33 = 221 Weq. In the final situation, all the 

contamination is removed, so the actual improvement = 221 Weq. 

Prevented future contamination It is estimated that at the end of the regarded time span, the soil contamination is increased to 30 m^3 (12 m^3 > I, 18 m^3 > T), and the groundwater contamination to 500 m^3 (150 m^3 > I, 200 m^3 > T, 150 m^3 > S). 

The total prevented future contamination will be expressed in Seq en Weq: 

### soil: (12-10) A 1 + (18-14) A 0.67 = 4.68 Seq 

### groundwater: (150-100) A 1 + (200-150) A 0.67 + (150-63) A 0.33 = 112 Weq 


The total maximum benefits for the environment are thus: 

 soil: 19.38 + 4.68 = 24.1 Seq 

 groundwater: 221 + 112 = 333 Weq 

Least desirable scenario Default situation: the contaminated soil is only replaced by clean soil. Therefore to only benefit is the prevention of spreading (this is already calculated in the first scenario = 4.68 Seq). The sacrifices for this benefit are: 

### use of soil: 24 A 1 = 24 Seq. 

Thus the total score on soil in the worst-case scenario is: 

 soil: 4.68 24 = -19.3 Seq 

Default situation: the use of groundwater the worst-case is that a lot of clean groundwater is withdrawn for containment, but without cleaning the contaminated groundwater. So the only benefit is the prevention of spreading (calculated in the first scenario). The maximum groundwater withdrawal is the withdrawal of geohydrological containment (0.1 m^3 /h for a period of 30 years). 

This leads to the following calculation: 

### groundwater withdrawal: 0.1 A 24 A 365 A 30 = 26280 Weq. 

Thus the total score on groundwater in the worst-case scenario is: 

 groundwater: 112 26280 = -26168 Weq. 

Use of drinking waterUse of drinking water Default situation: Sometimes the withdrawal of groundwater is compensated by infiltration. In a best-case scenario the use of drinking water is 0. The least desired scenario uses 90 % of the total amount of water withdrawn, in this case 23652 m^3. 

Use of energyUse of energy Default situation: In the best-case scenario no energy is used for remedial action. A least desirable scenario for energy consumption is the following. For the calculation of energy use five elements are the most important in the calculation, they will be considered: 

1. pumping of the groundwater; 

2. treatment of the groundwater; 

3. excavation of the soil; 

4. transport of the soil; 

5. treatment of the soil. 


Least desirable scenario Remedial action: 

- groundwater pumped is the same amount is in the worst-case scenario of groundwater; 

- all this water must be treated; 

- all contaminated soil is excavated; 

- all soil is treated in a thermal treatment plant off-site (distance 100 km from the site); 

- all clean soil is transported to the site from a distance 100 km. 

The normal energy consumption of the five elements above is the following: 

m^3 water pumping a m 

### . 0.02 MJ (electricity) 

### m^3 cleaning of water. 0.36 MJ (electricity) 

### ton soil excavated. 42 MJ (diesel, 35 ton excavated per hour by a digging machine) 

### ton soil transport a km. 1.3 MJ (diesel, considered a truck 1 km full and 1 km empty) 

### thermal treatment (ton). 60 MJ (electricity) 

For the default-situation this leads to a total energy consumption of: 

E: water withdrawal (head 4m) 

#### 2102 MJ 

E: m^3 water treatment 8226 MJ D: soil excavation 3754 MJ D: soil transport 10608 MJ D: soil treatment 16320 MJ ))))) 33584 MJ 

Use of spaceUse of space The minimum of space is 0, the maximum scenario is a total use of the space, which is 250m^2. 

Emissions to the airEmissions to the air The best-case scenario has 0 Aeq. emission to the air. The worst-case scenario is the same as the worst-case scenario of energy-consumption. With conversion factors of annexe 2 this leads to: 

### 12156 (Electricity) A 4,5 46478 

### 23256 (Diesel) A 6.7 155818 

Total 202300 Aeq. 

Surface water emissionsSurface water emissions Again the best-case scenario has 0 Weq. In the least desirable scenario all the extracted water is emitted to the surface water, containing concentrations that exceed the surface water standards with a factor 10. This results in 262800 Weq. The results are summarized in table C1.

### RISICOREDUCTIE, MILIEUVERDIENSTE, KOSTEN RISICOREDUCTIE, MILIEUVERDIENSTE, KOSTEN 

### (RMK-METHODE): STAP(RMK-METHODE): STAP 4 WORKSHOP 21 JUNI 19964 WORKSHOP 21 JUNI 1996 

E1 InleidingInleiding 

Deze bijlage bevat een verslag van de activiteiten in stap 4 van het NOBIS-project Risicoreductie, Milieuverdienste, Kosten (RMK, engelse afkorting REC). Deze bijlage vormt tezamen met het onderhavige rapport de afsluiting van fase 1 van het project. 

Doel van de eerste fase van het RMK-project is het ontwikkelen van een methodiek voor het bepalen van Risicoreductie, Milieuverdienste en Kosten en het toetsen van deze eerste invulling op draagvlak voor het concept. Tevens moet aan het eind van fase 1 duidelijk zijn of en op welke wijze het project in fase 2 moet worden voortgezet. 

In E2 zal het doel en de opzet van de workshop worden toegelicht. In E3 wordt een aantal generieke discussiepunten besproken, zoals die in de plenaire ochtendsessie zijn besproken. In E4 wordt verslag gedaan van de afzonderlijke sessies. E5 geeft een eerste opzet van de vervolgacties in fase 2. 

E2 Doel en opzet van de workshopDoel en opzet van de workshop 

Het doel van de workshop, die op 21 juni 1996 is gehouden in Hoog Brabant (Utrecht) van 10.00 tot 17.00 uur, is drieledig: 

1. generale toetsing van het concept RMK; 

2. inventarisatie van aspecten die nadere aandacht vergen; 

3. selectie van aspecten die moeten worden uitgewerkt in fase 2. 

De doelgroep van de workshop bestaat uit deskundigen die vanuit hun werkveld worden geacht een zinvolle bijdrage te kunnen leveren aan de discussie. De deelnemerslijst van de workshop is opgenomen in bijlage 1. 

Ter voorbereiding aan de workshop is een uitgebreide vragenlijst aan de deelnemers toegestuurd, waarin voor de verschillende sessies de discussiepunten zijn aangegeven. Deze vragenlijst is opgenomen in bijlage 2. 

Aan het begin van de workshop is het 'Mission Statement van de workshop' toegelicht: 

De aanwezigen op de workshop vormen een 'klankbord' voor het consortium. Door discussie over de 'eerste uitwerking' van de RMK-methode wordt de gekozen 'richting getoetst' en wordt 'inspiratie' voor het vervolgtraject opgedaan. Door tijdige (en regelmatige) terugkoppeling met experts en gebruikers moet het draagvlak voor RMK worden vergroot. 

Voor het consortium is het van belang om in een vroegtijdig stadium te toetsen of de ingeslagen richting de juiste is en welke verbeteringen kunnen worden aangebracht opdat het draagvlak wordt vergroot. Tevens moeten de knelpunten, zowel inhoudelijk als qua toepassing worden geÃ¯nventariseerd en geÃ«valueerd. In de evaluatie van de knelpunten moet worden vastgesteld of het knelpunt belangrijk is, of het kan worden opgelost, wie hierbij moet worden betrokken en op welke termijn dit moet plaatshebben. 

Ter positionering van het RMK-project binnen NOBIS heeft de heer Deelen (VROM, bestuurslid NOBIS) een korte inleiding gehouden. Hierbij is de relatie gelegd tussen de missie van NOBIS (opheffen van stagnatie van maatschappelijke processen door significante kostenreductie van bodemsanering met behulp van extensieve grootschalige in situ sanering) en de positie van in situ sanering binnen de saneringsalternatieven. Bij het vergelijken van saneringsstrategieÃ«n worden varianten met verschillende doelen en tijdspanne met elkaar vergeleken. Wanneer alleen naar de gerealiseerde bodemkwaliteit als resultaat wordt gekeken, zal in situ sanering in de afweging ten opzicht van andere strategieÃ«n een onduidelijke plaats innemen. De oplossingsrichting voor dit knelpunt is de afweging van alternatieven 


meer integraal te benaderen, en varianten te beoordelen op de bijdrage aan risicoreductie, milieuverdienste en kostenreductie. NOBIS acht dit project voor het programma van groot belang, aangezien dit de acceptatie van in situ saneringen kan vergroten. 

E3 Generieke discussiepuntenGenerieke discussiepunten 

In de ochtendsessie wordt een viertal discussiepunten plenair besproken die betrekking hebben op het RMK-concept. Deze discussiepunten zijn: 

1. toepassingen van de RMK-methode; 

2. beperking van de methode tot R, M en K; 

3. relatie tussen Milieuverdienste en Risicoreductie; 

4. relatie R, M en K en de tijd. 

In het onderstaande zal de discussie in het kort worden weergegeven. 

E3.1 Toepassingen RMK 

In het rapport wordt in figuur 1.1. een aantal niveaus onderscheiden waar de RMK-methode zou kunnen worden toegepast. De eerste fase, waarin RMK kan worden gebruikt, is het ontwerpstadium, het tweede de vergelijking van varianten voor een situatie, de derde toepassing betreft de evaluatie van lopende en afgeronde projecten en de laatste toepassing betreft het vergelijken van verschillende locaties met als doel het prioriteren van maatregelen. Het detailniveau van de toepassing verschilt en vraagt om een ander detailniveau van input informatie. Bovendien stelt de toepassing gelijktijdig op verschillende locaties andere eisen aan de methode (externe referentie) dan wanneer de methode slechts op Ã©Ã©n locatie tegelijkertijd wordt toegepast (interne referentie). In de discussie zijn de volgende aspecten naar voren gebracht: 

- Als het concept goed wordt uitgewerkt, is het in principe voor alle toepassingen bruikbaar. Er mag     geen verschil in de methode zitten voor de verschillende toepassingen (consistentie). 

- Er bestaan twijfels ten aanzien van de inzetbaarheid van RMK als instrument voor prioriteitsstelling:     voor prioriteitsstelling spelen andere dan R,M en K-criteria een doorslaggevende rol. 

- De doelstellingen moeten verder worden geÃ«xpliciteerd. Evaluatie van lopende saneringen kan voor     twee doelen worden uitgevoerd: het toetsen van de kwaliteit van de RMK-methode (continue     verbetering van het model door evaluatie van werkelijke risico's, milieufactoren, enz.) of voor het     evalueren van de in situ technieken zelf (met als doel de uitvoering van in situ technieken te     verbeteren). 

- Het benodigde informatie niveau voor het uitvoeren van een RMK-beoordeling bepaalt in grote mate     de kosten voor de toepassing. 

- Er moet onderscheid worden gemaakt in 'RMK-denken' en 'RMK-toepassing van de     methode'. Door kennis en toepassing van de RMK-methode ontstaat RMK-denken dat een     belangrijke rol in de ontwerpfase kan spelen (b.v. ondersteund door een checklist van factoren die in     sterke mate de scores op R, M en K bepalen). 

- Een breed gedragen voorstel van de aanwezigen is om ook in fase 2 in eerste instantie de RMK-     methode uit te ontwikkelen voor de toepassing 'vergelijking van saneringsvarianten', van waaruit de     aanpassing naar de andere toepassingen moet worden gerealiseerd. Het is wel van belang deze     andere toepassingen (ontwerpfase en evaluatie) steeds in beschouwing te nemen. 

E3.2 Beperking van de methode tot R, M en K 

Het NOBIS-project beoogt een methode te ontwikkelen die de besluitvorming met betrekking tot saneringsvarianten ondersteund. Hierbij is een subset van alle mogelijke relevante aspecten gekozen (R, M en K). Psycho-sociale en sociaal maatschappelijke factoren zijn niet in RMK opgenomen. Vraag aan de aanwezigen of dit acceptabel is. 

- Het is van belang de gebruiksmogelijkheden van een locatie in RMK op te nemen. Dit is feitelijk reeds     het geval binnen Risicoreductie (gebruiksspecifieke scenario's) en mogelijk binnen Kosten 


 (waardeverandering van terreinen). Overigens is hierbij opgemerkt dat functionaliteit van varianten ook kan worden gezien als een randvoorwaarde (alle voorgestelde varianten moeten tenminste het gewenste gebruik mogelijk maken, RMK komt dan pas aan de beurt om tussen de overgebleven opties te selecteren). 

- Veiligheid is tot op heden nog niet uitgewerkt en zou wellicht binnen risicoreductie moeten worden     opgenomen. 

- Psycho-sociale en sociaal maatschappelijke factoren worden door de aanwezigen als zeer belangrijke     factoren in de besluitvorming onderkent. Men is echter ook van mening dat dit zich moeilijk laat     objectiveren in een methode als RMK. Bovendien wordt RMK gezien als een aanvulling op het     proces van afweging en selectie van saneringsoplossingen en niet als een vervanging. Incompleetheid     is vrijwel per definitie het geval. Het wordt juist als de kracht van RMK gezien dat een duidelijke     inperking van aspecten is gemaakt. De kracht van beslissingsondersteunende systemen ligt in de     vrijheid die de gebruiker heeft (teveel vrijheidsbeperking leidt tot non-acceptatie). Besloten wordt om     ook in het vervolg geen psycho-sociale factoren in RMK op te nemen. 

- Restrisico's bij in situ saneringen zijn op voorhand moeilijk in te schatten en vormen vaak een     belangrijk argument om van in situ af te zien. De vraag is of de huidige methode in voldoende mate     tegenwicht aan deze argumenten geeft. Juist door het kwantificeren van 'residu-blootstelling' is     restrisico gerelateerd aan het totale risico, waarmee getracht is restrisico's te beoordelen. Afstemming     met het NOBIS-project 'restrisico's' is belangrijk en wordt gerealiseerd door de betrokkenheid van de     kennisontwikkelaars bij beide projecten. 

E3.3 Relatie tussen Milieuverdienste en Risicoreductie 

Bij de definitie van de criteria Milieuverdienste en Risicoreductie is de oorzaak gevolg keten gebruikt en is een onderscheid gemaakt in schaalniveau waarop de criteria betrekking hebben. 

- Ten aanzien van het begrip Risicoreductie wordt opgemerkt dat bij de invulling gekozen is voor het     beoordelen van blootsteling en dat dit niet synoniem is aan risico. Voor stoffen waarvoor een     'geen-effect' niveau kan worden aangegeven, is blootstelling onder de TDI geen risico meer, maar nog     wel blootstelling. Deze discussie wordt in de subsessie risicoreductie verder uitgewerkt. 

- Door de invulling van het begrip Risicoreductie (afnemende risico's voor gebruikers van het terrein +     risico's van saneringswerknemers) is het mogelijk dat de numerieke waarde van risicoreductie negatief     wordt: als het risico voor het saneren groter is dan de afname van risico's voor gebruikers. Het begrip     Risicoreductie is dan wellicht verwarrend. 

- Bij de invulling van Milieuverdienste is gekozen voor vaststelling van potentiÃ«le beÃ¯nvloeding van de     milieukwaliteit. Naar de mening van enkele aanwezigen is dit een achteruitgang ten opzichte van de     ontwikkelingen in internationaal verband waar wordt getracht daadwerkelijke veranderingen in     milieukwaliteit vast te stellen. Omwille van een heldere scheiding tussen Risicoreductie en     Milieuverdienste is het noodzakelijk bij de invulling van Milieuverdienste niet de volledige doorvertaling     naar effecten na te streven (behalve waar het om risico's voor geÃ¯dentificeerde objecten gaat). De     filosofie van Milieverdienste is dat het ongeacht de plaats van handeling de mogelijke beÃ¯nvloeding     van milieukwaliteit of gebruik van milieuruimte (schaarse goederen) meeneemt. In de onderlinge     relatie van verschillende milieu-aspecten komen de uiteindelijke effecten weer in beeld voor de     normalisatie. 

E3.4 Relatie R, M en K en de tijd 

In het rapport is toegelicht dat uitgaven die gespreid in de tijd plaatshebben door middel van disconteren naar een netto contante waarde worden omgerekend. Voor de in de tijd gespreide risico's en milieu-invloeden zou dit ook kunnen, als de filosofie achter disconteren (namelijk het verrekenen van opportunity kosten van geld en inflatie) ook voor risico's en milieu-invloeden gelden. In het rapport is voorgesteld R en M niet te disconteren. 

- Er is een directe relatie tussen de totale tijdsduur die wordt beschouwd en disconteren. Als de     beschouwde tijdsduur wordt beperkt, is dit impliciet een vorm van disconteren (door effecten na dit     tijdstip niet meer mee te rekenen). Daarnaast kan binnen de gekozen tijdsduur nog discontering 


 worden toegepast. Het is van belang om de gevoeligheid van de RMK-beoordeling voor de keuze van de saneringstermijn te toetsen. 

- Als een korte termijn wordt geselecteerd, ligt de nadruk van de vergelijking van varianten op de wijze     waarop dit wordt gerealiseerd (het saneringsproces), terwijl bij een langere tijdsduur het gerealiseerde     eindresultaat zwaarder meetelt (een laag restrisico over een lange periode kan een aanzienlijke     bijdrage aan R geven). Het is daarom van belang om de gebruiker van RMK inzicht te geven in de     ontwikkeling van R, M en K in de tijd (grafisch) in plaats van alleen een geÃ¯ntegreerde score. 

- De RMK-methode moet de gebruiker de vrijheid geven de tijd in te stellen. Voor de defaultwaarde     wordt de voorkeur gegeven aan een lange tijdsas (100 jaar). Hierover zal met verschillende     marktpartijen aan de hand van cases moeten worden gediscussieerd. 

- Er is opgemerkt dat het meetellen van risico's voor aanvang van de sanering eigenlijk niet juist is. Het     is echter de verwachting van de ontwikkelaars dat er steeds vaker een afweging zal moeten worden     gemaakt (op een bepaald moment) of uitstel van sanering in vergelijking met direct     beginnen acceptabel is. Voor de toepassing als vergelijkingsinstrument is dit derhalve essentieel. 

E4 Conclusies uit subsessies R, M en KConclusies uit subsessies R, M en K 

In deze paragraaf worden de belangrijkste conclusies ten aanzien van de discussie in de drie subsessies samengevat. 

E4.1 Risicoreductie 

In subsessie Risicoreductie is ingegaan op de vragen zoals geformuleerd in bijlage 2. 

Aspecten die bij Risicoreductie moeten worden meegenomen Algemeen werd opgemerkt dat objecten die vervangbaar zijn niet in het criterium risicoreductie zouden moeten worden opgenomen. Vervangbare objecten zijn in kosten uit te drukken. Met dit uitgangspunt zouden alleen de mens en het milieu op de locatie onder risicoreductie vallen. 

Ten aanzien van de in tabel 3.3 opgenomen objecten werd het volgende opgemerkt: 

Omwonenden: Relevant, moeten worden beschermd. 

Werknemers: Niet relevant, Op enkele uitzonderingen na zijn er geen werknemers die blootstellingsrisico's ondervinden als gevolg van bodemverontreiniging. Werknemers kunnen echter wel in het model worden opgenomen. 

Saneerders: Niet relevant gezien de veiligheidsmaatregelen. Voorgesteld wordt de risico's voor saneerders eenmaal goed in te schatten en aan de hand daarvan te bekijken of het in de tweede fase moet worden meegenomen. 

Ecosysteem: De aansluiting die is gezocht bij de urgentiesystematiek wordt op pragmatische gronden juist gevonden. Omdat het merendeel van de bodemverontreinigingsgevallen in industrieel/stedelijk gebied liggen, vraagt men zich af of het criterium wel onderscheidend werkt. Als vee/vegetatie in economische schade zijn uit te drukken, moet dit bij de kosten worden meegenomen. Infrastructuur/ overige objecten: Indien vervangbaar (in geld uit te drukken) niet meenemen. 

Calamiteiten: Als op lokaal niveau een significante kans op schade kan optreden, moet dit worden geÃ¯dentificeerd. In de systematiek behoeft het niet als onderscheidend criterium te worden opgenomen. Het opnemen van calamiteiten in een voetnoot wordt voldoende geacht. Achtergrondblootstelling/ combinatietoxiciteit: Beide criteria kunnen een rol spelen, er is echter een beleidsmatige principe uitspraak noodzakelijk over hoe met beide moet worden omgegaan. Achtergrond kan mogelijk een rol spelen bij de beslissing wel of niet saneren. Combinatietoxiciteit voor PAK en chloorfenolen moet worden meegenomen. Ten 


aanzien van risicoreductie kan mogelijk worden uitgegaan van het beoordelen van de door bodemverontreiniging toegevoegde blootstelling. 


Berekenen van Risicoreductie 

### De weergegeven relatie R = RIndex A n A t is acceptabel, maar werd niet zozeer gezien als een relatie in 

termen van afhankelijke grootheden maar meer als functie. In de functie wordt het verloop van de risico's als functie van de tijd weergegeven. Een belangrijke vraag voor de tweede fase is de tijdschaal. Met name het onderscheid tussen chronische en incidentele blootstelling is van belang. Als RIndex wordt gehanteerd voor de toetsing van blootstelling is de relatie mogelijk niet bruikbaar voor weergave van risico. Aangegeven werd dat duidelijk het verschil tussen blootstellingsreductie en risicoreductie moest worden aangegeven. Door toxicologen kan mogelijk de relatie tussen beide worden uitgezocht. De discussie over kwantificeren van de blootstelling spitste zich toe op het modelleren van het pad, met name in de toekomst. Op dit punt kan de systematiek mogelijk worden uitgebreid. Ten aanzien van risico's als gevolg van verspreiding werd aangegeven dat dit mogelijk een onderdeel was voor milieuverdienste. Het gebruik van subgroepen in relatie tot blootstelling werd acceptabeler geacht. Het aansluiten bij geaccepteerde normen werd als positief ervaren. Ten aanzien van humane risico's werd aangegeven dat onder het MTR geen nadelige effecten worden verwacht en dus niet kan worden gesproken over risicoreductie; beter is de term blootstellingsreductie. Ten aanzien van de MAC-waarde 

### wordt aangegeven dat in analogie met de arbo-wetgeving beter kan worden uitgegaan van 0,2 A MAC. 

Ten aanzien van ecosystemen werd aangegeven dat de voorgestelde benadering als best bruikbaar kon worden gehanteerd. Voor een betere beoordeling van ecologische risico's zou een uitgebreide studie naar het effect op bodemecosystemen moeten worden uitgevoerd. Dit valt echter buiten het kader van het RMK-project. 

Integreren van objecten Met het voorstel om alle objecten in eerste instantie gelijkwaardig te beoordelen werd ingestemd. De onderlinge weging is een maatschappelijke keuze. De mogelijkheid zou moeten worden geboden om af te wijken van defaultwaarde 1 voor de weging van objecten. Ten aanzien van ecologische risico's werd aangegeven dat een weegfactor al is verdisconteerd in de gehanteerde methodiek die immers gebiedstype afhankelijk is. 

Praktische toepasbaarheid Aangegeven was dat de systematiek zo simpel mogelijk moest zijn. Als voorbeeld werd de systematiek van Utrecht aangehaald. Het model lijkt het algemene gevoel goed weer te geven. Uiteindelijk moest het RMK-model een transparant model worden waarin objectieve zaken worden vastgelegd en subjectieve zaken door middel van een weegfactor aan de gebruikers worden gelaten. 

E4.2 Milieuverdienste 

In subsessie Milieuverdienste is ingegaan op de vragen zoals geformuleerd in bijlage 2. Algemeen werd opgemerkt dat het begrip milieuverdienste communicatief verwarrend is: er vallen namelijk zowel baten als lasten onder dit begrip in de huidige methodiek. Wellicht is iets van 'milieubalans' beter. De naamgeving van 'voorkomen van toekomstige verontreiniging' (prevention of future contamination) is ongelukkig: standstill wordt duidelijker gevonden. 

Aspecten die bij Milieuverdienste moeten worden meegenomen In verband met internationale ontwikkelingen in het kader van de LCA-methodiek wordt benadrukt dat aansluiting hierbij zinvol is. Hierbij is het niet noodzakelijk om het concept van de LCA over te nemen, maar kan het nuttig gebruik worden vergroot. Voorgesteld wordt om bij het uitwerken van een case ook de beschikbare tools (LCA) op deze case los te laten en de meerwaarde van een dergelijke instrument te beoordelen. 

Bij de geÃ¯dentificeerde factoren die relevant worden geacht voor de bepaling van milieuverdienste werd aan de opbrengstzijde toegevoegd: het vrijkomen van nuttige producten. Het gelijk waarderen van schone (aanvul)grond en thermisch gereinigde grond werd onjuist geacht: waardeverschillen moeten tot uitdrukking komen door schone grond als gebruik te rekenen en gereinigde grond als een nuttig product (met lagere milieuwaarde). 


Er bestaat consensus over de geselecteerde aspecten. Er is echter behoefte aan de onderbouwing van de selectie: het gebruik van materialen en chemicaliÃ«n zou in sommige gevallen relevant kunnen zijn, alsmede tweede orde processen (de productie van actief kool). Als dit door middel van geringe inspanning kan worden onderbouwd (zonder dat het wordt opgenomen in RMK), vormt dit een versterking van de basis van Milieuverdienste. Door Iwaco en Tauw uitgevoerde onderzoeken naar LCAanalyses bij bodemsanering kunnen hiervoor een basis bieden. 

De aanname dat lozing op het riool niet leidt tot beÃ¯nvloeding van milieukwaliteit is te ruw: een berekening met een gemiddeld reinigingsrendement van de RWZI zou beter zijn. 

Stank en geluid kunnen wellicht worden meegenomen in Risicoreductie (gekoppeld aan objecten) daar waar het als gezondheidsbepalende factor wordt geÃ¯dentificeerd. 

Integratie van aspecten In de subdiscussie is geen tijd besteed aan de discussie over de integratie van de geÃ¯dentificeerde milieu-aspecten. Suggesties die hiervoor gedaan zijn, betreffen de relatie van milieu-aspecten aan de doelstellingen voor de aspecten of achterliggende milieuthema's. Tevens is aangegeven dat voor het vaststellen van het onderling belang van factoren het vaststellen van waarderingsfuncties door gesprekken met experts te voeren een bruikbare methode is. Het is vooral belangrijk om een aantal uiteenlopende cases uit te werken en op basis hiervan de gesprekken te voeren. 

Praktische bruikbaarheid Ten aanzien van de praktische bruikbaarheid van de RMK-methode wordt opgemerkt dat het geheel niet veel complexer kan worden dan het op dit moment is. Aanvullingen en wijzigingen mogen niet resulteren in een complexere uitvoering van de methode. 

E4.3 Kosten 

In de subsessie kosten is ingegaan op de vragen zoals geformuleerd in bijlage 2. 

Aspecten die bij Kosten moeten worden meegenomen Er is uitgebreid gediscussieerd over de vraag in hoeverre waardeverandering moet en kan worden meegenomen in de RMK-methode. De waarde van een terrein is afhankelijk van de ligging, de gebruikswaarde, de fiscale waarde, de boekwaarde, en dergelijke. Kosten als gevolg van waardeverandering zouden moeten worden gerelateerd aan toekomstig gebruik en met inachtneming van de planningshorizon van de probleembezitter. Dit is nauwelijks kwantificeerbaar. Conclusie is dat er wel kosten zijn, dat dit een enorm effect kan hebben, maar dat dit erg specifiek is en erg afhankelijk van de perceptie van de waarde. Dit is een brug te ver voor de RMK-methode. 

Kwantificering van het criterium Kosten Bij de tijdwaarde van geld moet onderscheid worden gemaakt in vermogensinvesteringen, variabele of lopende kosten en de wijze van disconteren (technologisch of monetair). Zoals het nu in de RMKmethode is uitgewerkt, wordt voor alle financiÃ«le uitgaven (aanvangsinvesteringen, herinvesteringen, lopende kosten) een monetaire discontering toegepast. Het is denkbaar dat vanuit een ander perspectief dit disconteren anders of niet moet plaatshebben. Als saneringskosten worden gezien als 'operating costs' vormt dit mogelijk geen onderdeel van de 'investeringsbeslissing bodemsanering' (deze kosten worden dan geheel niet meegenomen?). Kapitalisatie is afhankelijk van de specifieke situatie en moet in de methode met de nodige vrijheid worden ingevoerd. 

Het verdelen van kosten over verschillende kostendragers wordt binnen de subsessie als niet zinvol geacht. In de afweging van varianten gaat het om de totale kosten en niet om de wijze van financiering. Hierbij wordt opgemerkt dat als RMK wordt gebruikt om de communicatie tussen partijen over de keuze van een saneringsvariant te bevorderen, inzicht in de kosten per partij wel van belang worden geacht. 

De onzekerheden in kosten kunnen verschillende oorzaken hebben: 

- het niet systematisch evalueren van werkelijke kosten ten opzichte van geraamde kosten; 

- onzekerheden ten aanzien van verontreinigingssituatie en bodemopbouw; 

- onzekerheden ten aanzien van de performance van een technologie; 

- onzekerheden ten aanzien van de prijsontwikkeling van saneringskosten; 

- onzekerheden ten aanzien van ontwikkelingen op de kapitaalmarkt (rente, inflatie). 


De algemene mening is dat er onvoldoende financiÃ«le expertise in het consortium aanwezig is. Voorstel voor fase 2 is om door experts van bijvoorbeeld Berenschot Osborne, Brink Groep of KPMG naar het kostencriterium te laten kijken. 

E5 Vervolgacties voor fase 2Vervolgacties voor fase 2 

Op basis van de discussies die op de workshop zijn gevoerd, is de volgende richting voor het vervolg van het RMK-project aan te geven. 

De methode 'RMK' Ten aanzien van het proces van totstandkoming van de RMK-methode is er een grote mate van consensus met alle betrokkenen. Het is van groot belang de balans te bewaren tussen enerzijds de toepasbaarheid van de methode, rekening houdend met de beschikbare gegevens, tijd en middelen en anderzijds de degelijkheid van de methode: gelijkwaardige aandacht voor R, M en K, onderbouwde keuzen en een doordachte invulling en integratie. 

Het is dan ook de algemene mening dat het uitwerken van voorbeeldprojecten en de op basis van deze resultaten verdere discussie de beste methode is voor de verdere ontwikkeling van de voorliggende eerste invulling van de methode. Voordat echter aan deze toetsprojecten kan worden begonnen, is het van belang een aantal inhoudelijke aspecten nader uit te werken. 

Voor het toepasbaar maken van het criterium Milieuverdienste is het noodzakelijk om een nadere discussie te voeren over de integratie van aspecten. In discussie met een beperkte groep specialisten kan een eerste invulling van de onderlinge weging van aspecten worden uitgewerkt. Aan de hand van de cases kan een en ander verder worden ingevuld. Voor een case kan een LCA-berekening worden uitgevoerd om de selectie van aspecten te onderbouwen (uitsluiting chemicaliÃ«n, materialen, tweede orde processen). 

Voor het verder uitwerken van het criterium Kosten kan expertise buiten het consortium worden gezocht. 

Na deze 'aanscherping van de voorliggende methode' wordt een aantal case-projecten geselecteerd, waarvoor een RMK-beoordeling wordt uitgevoerd. Naast partijen in het consortium is het wellicht zinvol Ã©Ã©n of meer externe partijen een RMK-beoordeling te laten uitvoeren. 

Deze case-projecten hebben tot doel de gebruikersvriendelijkheid van de methode te toetsen, alsmede de bruikbaarheid van de uitkomsten voor het proces van onderhandeling over de selectie van saneringsvarianten. Het is van groot belang verschillende partijen van belanghebbenden in dit proces te betrekken. 

Uit deze case-projecten komen conclusies en aanbevelingen ten aanzien van: 

- verdere uitwerking van onderdelen die onvoldoende blijken te zijn uitgewerkt; 

- eliminatie van aspecten die niet relevant blijken; 

- aanbevelingen voor het verhogen van de communicatieve waarde van RMK. 

Communicatietraject Gedurende de looptijd van fase 2 is een voortdurende communicatie met betrokken partijen van belang. Naast terugkoppeling tussen consortium en begeleidingscommissie is verbreding naar andere marktpartijen van belang. Dit stelt hoge eisen aan de uitwerking van het projectplan van fase 2. Niet alleen neemt de complexiteit aan activiteiten toe, tevens zal het aantal betrokkenen toenemen. 

Op basis van de evaluatie van de ervaringen in fase 1 van het project is het van groot belang de discussie met betrekking tot de inhoudelijke invulling van de verschillende activiteiten, en de hiermee samenhangende verdeling van taken en verantwoordelijkheden voorafgaande aan deze activiteiten, vast te leggen. Fase 2 zal dan ook moeten beginnen met een degelijke definitiestudie voor fase 2 (fase 2A). Product van fase 2A is een activiteitenplan en een herziene projectorganisatie.

2. Hoe berekenen we risicoreductie? 

### Is de relatie R = RIndex A n A t duidelijk en acceptabel? (zie 3.4.1) 

 Kan RIndex worden gedefinieerd als blootstelling/toetsingsnorm? (zie 3.4.2) Is n een maat voor de blootgestelde individuen of soortensamenstelling? (zie 3.4.2) Kunnen kortdurende en langdurige blootstelling worden gesommeerd aan de hand van tijdsfracties? (zie 3.5) Kan de blootstelling van objecten aan bodemverontreiniging worden gekwantificeerd? Is de keuze voor het afzonderlijk beoordelen van subgroepen (kinderen, volwassenen) gewenst? (3.4.2) Is het gebruik van TDI, MAC en HC 50 gewenst c.q. acceptabel? (zie 3.4.3) Kan de blootstelling van het ecosysteem worden benaderd door beoordeling van concentratie niveaus in de bovengrond? (zie 3.4.2) 

3. Hoe integreren we risicoreductie voor de geÃ¯dentificeerde objecten?     Is het Maximaal Toelaatbaar Risico-Niveau een maatschappelijke keuze?     Is MTRhumaan = MTReco?     Is het aantal blootgestelde objecten (n) equivalent met het genormaliseerde oppervlak voor het     ecosysteem? (zie 3.4.2)     Kan het totale risico worden bepaald door sommatie van de onderdelen? (zie 3.5)     Is er behoefte aan weegfactoren die het belang van de afzonderlijke onderdelen kan beÃ¯nvloeden?     (zie 3.5) 

4. Is de voorgestelde werkwijze (na aanpassingen en verdere uitwerking) praktisch toepasbaar? 


Milieuverdienste ConceptConcept Is Milieuverdienste een verschil tussen positieve en negatieve aspecten voor het milieu? (zie 4.3) Moeten bij de negatieve aspecten van milieuverdienste zowel aspecten worden meegenomen die gerelateerd zijn aan 'schaarste van goederen' als aspecten die gerelateerd zijn aan potentiÃ«le milieukwaliteitsbeÃ¯nvloeding? (zie 4.2.1) Is de tijd voor milieuverdienste relevant, of kan worden volstaan met een verschilmeting tussen begin en eindsituatie? (zie 2.1.2) 

1. Welke aspecten moeten in milieuverdienste worden meegenomen? (zie 4.3)

2. Hoe berekenen we milieuverdienste?     Is de relatie TEIpositief - TEnegatief duidelijk en acceptabel? (zie 2.1.2 en 4.3)     Sluit het concept aan bij wat onder een milieubalans van activiteiten verondersteld wordt?     Moet in de vaststelling van TEIpositief rekening worden gehouden met de verbeterde grond- en     grondwaterkwaliteit en de preventie van toekomstige verspreiding? (zie 4.4.1)     Moet er gewerkt worden met kwaliteitsindices om de relatieve verbetering te beoordelen? (zie 4.4.1)     Kunnen de negatieve aspecten die gerelateerd zijn aan het gebruik van schaarse goederen worden     gecombineerd met de negatieve aspecten die gerelateerd zijn met emissies? (zie 4.4.2 en 4.4.3)     Heeft er een ongerechtvaardigde dubbeltelling plaats door energieverbruik en emissies als gevolg van     energieverbruik op te nemen? (zie 4.4.3)     Kunnen emissies worden omgezet in lucht- en waterequivalenten met behulp van kwaliteitsdoelstel-     lingen? (zie 4.4.3) 

3. Hoe integreren we de verschillende aspecten binnen milieuverdienste?     Is de voorgestelde wijze van standaardisatie tussen minimum en maximum gewenst c.q.     acceptabel? (zie 4.5.2) 


 Is het gebruik van een locatiespecifieke standaardisatie een probleem voor de toepassing van RMK als relatief instrument voor de vergelijking van gegenereerde varianten? (zie 4.5.2) Is het mogelijk door middel van expertpanels te komen tot een onderlinge weging van de 

### geselecteerde criteria (1 m^3 schone grond is y A m^3 grondwater waard)? 

 Worden er andere uitkomsten verwacht als de onderlinge weging van milieu-invloeden wordt aangepast, of leidt dit tot dezelfde voorkeursvolgorde? Op welke wijze kan een onafhankelijke meetlat worden ontwikkeld waarop een absolute vergelijking van milieu-invloeden mogelijk is? In hoeverre is het voor een onafhankelijke meetlat nodig om naar effecten te kijken, en wat is dan het onderscheid met risicoreductie? 

4. Is de voorgestelde werkwijze, na aanpassing en verdere uitwerking toepasbaar in de praktijk? 

Kosten Moet onder het criterium kosten zowel de uitgaven (direct en indirect) voor de sanering als de verandering in waarde van terreinen en bezittingen worden meegenomen? (zie 5.2.1) Moet de tijdwaarde van geld (disconteren) worden meegenomen? (zie 2.3.1) Moeten alle kostenposten dezelfde kostendrager hebben (ofwel moeten kosten voor de 'opdrachtgever' en kosten voor derden (b.v. de kosten van bevoegd gezag) worden gescheiden?

2. Hoe berekenen we kosten?     Welke kapitalisatiemethode moet worden gebruikt voor het disconteren van toekomstige kosten? (zie     5.4)     Welke rente- en inflatiepercentages moeten worden gehanteerd? Is dit afhankelijk van de     kostendrager?     Met welke onzekerheden moeten rekening worden gehouden in de kostenraming en op welke wijze?     (zie 5.4)
