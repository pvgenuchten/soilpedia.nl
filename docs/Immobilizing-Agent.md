### Preface 

This study was conducted in the fiamework of The Netherlands Integrated Soil Research Programme. The objectives were to summarize the state-of-theart and applicability of the use of adjuvants to immobilize heavy metals in the soil and to evaluate its applicability in The Netherlands. To this end an extensive literature study into the mode of action and the strengths and weaknesses of various immobilizing agents was conducted. The resulting overview was used to evaluate the applicability of the most promising immobilizing agents for the remediation of five cases of heavy metal polluted soils in The Netherlands. The study has been performed at the Research Institute for Agrobiology and Soil Fertility (AB-DLO) in Wageningen. 

This report consists of two parts. The fust part starts with a description of the developments in The Netherlands that have led to a new policy on issues related to soil protection and the resulting change in attitude towards novel techniques for the remediation of heavy metal contaminated soils. By means of an inventory of a series of five typical cases of heavy metal pollution in The Netherlands it wil1 then be evaluated to what extent these examples meet the criteria to apply selected irnmobilizing agents as a method of soil remediation. In the second part of this study (i.e. the appendix) it is explained in more detail what is known about the various immobilization methods described in the literature.

increase of pH, which in turn results in the solubilization of organic material in the soil solution (Dissolved Organic Carbon: DOC). Cu has a streng tendency to sorb to DOC, much strenger than the other aforementioned heavy metals. Beringite is therefore not suitable for immobilization of Cu, but it is suitable for the immobilization of Zn, Cd and Pb. The effect of beringite on Ni has not yet been described in the literature. 

Contrary to Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb are not only poorly soluble at high pH, but they also do not sorb significantly to DOC in the soil solution. Alor All3-montmorillonite and Mn-oxide are in principle suitable immobilizing agents for each of these heavy metals. Their effect can be enhanced by using them in combination with lime to increase the pH of the SOL The best way to imrnobilize Cu is by adding Alor All3-montmorillonite, or Mn-oxide to the soil without additional measures to increase the pH of the SOL Under reducing conditions Mnoxide wil1 dissolve, and hence heavy metals sorbed to Mn-oxide wil1 be remobilized. This characteristic makes Mn-oxide less suitable for use in wet areas. 

 The faal choice between the techniques mentioned above wil1 have to be based on the effectiveness of the immobilizing agents and the Wbility of the effects under field conditions. There is an urgent need for additional research into the effectiveness and stability of immobilizing agents in the field.

## n e r j e n a s ì e actief n b m o d eBij deze aanpak worden de te implementeren m c b e h e t e r. i 

 maatregelen afgestemd op het (beoogde) gebruik van de bodem. Hiertoe moet kennis worden ontwikkeld over risico’s van bodemverontreiniging in relatie tot bodemgebruik en over nieuwe technieken waarmee de risico’s van de verontreiniging worden gereduceerd, technieken die uiteraard betaalbaar en technisch uitvoerbaar moeten zijn. Een veelbelovende techniek is de toepassing van immobilisatoren. Immobilisatoren zijn stoffen die aan de bodem worden toegevoegd om met name anorganische verontreinigingen zoals zware metalen (Cu, Zn, Cd e.d.) te binden c.q. te immobiliseren. Het effect van immobilisatie is dat de verontreinigende stoffen niet meer beschikbaar zijn voor planten gewasopname, niet meer toxisch zijn voor het bodemleven, en niet meer uitspoelen naar het grondwater. 

 Sanering door middel van immobilisatoren betekent dat de verontreinigende stoffen niet worden verwijderd, maar in onschadelijke vorm in de bodem worden vastgelegd of ge.ïmmobiliseerd. Deze methode hoeft echter niet inferieur te zijn ten opzichte van verwijderen en vervangen van de grond. Een voordeel is namelijk dat de aanwezige immobilisator nieuwe (door atmosferische depositie aangevoerde) verontreinigende stoffen wegvangt. Een tweede, bijkomend voordeel van immobilisatoren is dat vaak de bodemstructuur verbeterd wordt, zodat er een betere plantenen gewasgroei mogelijk is. Sanering door techniek en er de aard van verantwoorde gekoppeld aan 

 middel van immobilisatoren is een relatief nieuwe, nog weinig toegepaste zijn geen standaard-recepten, mede vanwege locatiespecifieke factoren, mals de verontreiniging, het bodemtype en het bodemgebruik. Voor een toepassing van immobilisatoren dient daarom de uitvoering te worden onderzoek, waarin: 

 grond en vegetatie worden onderzocht op gehaltes aan beschikbare zware metalen; wordt nagegaan in hoeverre en met welke snelheid het bodemleven en het bodemecosysteem zich herstellen; in hoeverre zware metalen nog uitlogen; kennis wordt verzameld waarmee het mogelijk wordt om de techniek gedurende het saneringsproces (eventueel) te wijzigen en te perfectioneren. 

 Uit literatuuronderzoek komt naar voren dat er momenteel een aantal veelbelovende immobilisatoren beschikbaar is, die echter nog geen van alle voldoende getest zijn op veldschaal. Deze immobilisatoren zijn: beringiet, Alof AlIs-montmorilloniet en Mn-oxide. De keuze voor een immobilisator hangt af van de locatie (met name de zuurgraad van de grond) en de aard van de verontreiniging* Niet alle zware metalen gedragen zich hetzelfde in de bodem.

### 1 0 Introduction 

In The Netherlands we wil1 have to leam how to live with contaminated soils. The present govemment has opted for a pragmatic approach with as guiding principles _jùnction oriented remediation_ and _active soil management._ In this approach measures are to be taken with an eye on the (intended) use of the soil. To this end knowledge has to be developed (i) on the risks of soil contamination in relation to the use of that soil, and (ii) on new affordable techniques with which the risks of the presence of contaminants are reduced. A possible technique is the application of immobilizing agents. These are compounds, which, when added to the soil, make pollutants, especially heavy metals, less mobile, and hence less toxic. 

Much genera1 information is available on the mode of action of the various immobilizing agents. For the interested reader this information has been summarized and discussed in the second part of this brochure (i.e. the appendix). In the first part the available knowledge wil1 be focused on the Dutch situation. To this end five cases of heavy metal polluted soils in The Netherlands have been selected. After a short general introduction these specific cases wil1be described to outline how immobilizing agents could be used to remediate these sites. Thus the emphasis is on the criteria that decide which method is best. 

 This study focuses on heavy metals. Organic contaminants fa11outside the scope of the present study. The applicability of immobilization methods to remediate the large areas of phosphate enriched soils in The Netherlands has been discussed recently (Chardon et aZ. 1996). Ironically , one of the methods proposed in the literature to remediate Pb contaminated soils is by adding phosphate in order to precipitate Pb in the form of Pb phosphate minerals. In our perception this is like “driving out the devil with Beelzebub”. 

 11 l Policy developments 

 In the last decade the hope that within the foreseeable future spatial planning in The Netherlands can take place without having to pay attention to soil pollution has evaporated. Shortly after the stare of the fust case of serious soil pollution (Lekkerkerk, 1980) this was stil1 quite different. An evaluation of the total problem at that time suggested a cleanup operation of about 1 billion guilders. Based on this @ure the consensus was to get it over with as soon as possible and clean-up the polluted sites rapidly. Gradually this attitude turned out to be too optimistic. Ten years later it was clear that The Netherlands had no less than 100,000 seriously polluted sites, and that cleaning up al1 these cases would require an enormous effort with a price tag of more than 100 billion guilders. With this amount of money involved complete clean-up of al1the polluted soil in The Netherlands becomes unrealistic. This awareness has resulted in stagnation of 


the remediation efforts and has hampered the connected spatial and economie processes in the areas involved. 

Against this background a number of initiatives were taken in the 1990s to come to a new soil protection policy, which included an evaluation of the Soil Protection Act, and an interdepartmental policy analysis with regard to soil remediation which has culminated in a process of policy renewal with regard to soil remediation (BEVER). The government has recently come to the conclusion that: _SoiZ remediation is too expensive and the output_ of _the soil clean-up operation is too low, because per unit of time too little cases are treated. Futihermore the size of the soil pollution problem relative to the available means results in stagnation of spatial and economie processes. l3e result is social damage, little support for soil remediation, a low leve1 of investments, and a negative eflect on the qualig of the environment._ The govemment therefore stands for a new approach with as guiding principles function oriented remediation and active soil management. 

 1.2 Function oriented soil remediation and active soil management 

 Function oriented soil remediation means that the measures that are to be taken are tailored towards the desired soil usage. This împlies that the regulatory process is no longer based on “multifunctionality, unless”, but on an evaluation^ of the remediation result that has to be achieved; a process where controlling the exposure and dispersal risks comes fust, but where special attention is paid to the function and usage of the soil. By that, fúnction oriented remediation differs tiom the present policy on soil pollution which is based on a choice between either complete removal of the pollution, or isolation, containment and control. Consequently under the new policy there wil1 be more cases in which pollution wil1 remain in the soil than there would have been under the old rules and regulations. That is why mnction oriented soil remediation has to be embedded in active soil management. Active soil management encompasses the chain preventionmanagement-remediation-maintenance with the objective to achieve sustainable soil usage. From a perspective of soil remediation .active soil management aims at creating boundary conditions for dealing with soil pollution. Important elements in soil management are: 

 l protection of clean soils; l optimal use of polluted soils; l improving the quality of polluted soils where necessary and possible; l managing and controlling the quality of and activities in and on the soil.

 1.3.1 Principles 

 The principle of the application of heavy metal immobilizing agents is based on the awareness that the effects of heavy metak on plants and ether organisms in and on the soil are not determined by the total leve1 of heavy metals as such, but mainly by the concentration of these metals in the soil solution. As a result plants in a clay soil in which most of the heavy metals are bound to the clay, take up less heavy metals than plants in a sandy soil with the same amounts of heavy metals present. This has resulted in the present-day differentiation of wil standards: soils with a lot of clay and organic matter are allowed to contain more heavv met& than soils with low amounts of these binding substances. In addition to the l&els of clay and important for the availability of heavy metals; more easily than in an alkaline environment, immobilization approaches that can be applied immobilize heavy metals.

 1.3.2 Remediation 

Remediation by means of immobilization implies that contaminants are not removed but rather are fixed in the soil in an innocuous form, or immobilized. This method does not have to be inferior to removal and replacement of the soil. This is because the immobilizing agent wil1 also catch contaminants that wil1 be deposited later through the atmosphere. An additional advantage of immobilizing agents is that they often improve the soil structure, thus stimulating plant growth. Remediation by means of immobilizing agents is a relatively new, little applied technique, and there are no standard recipes available, also because of the importante of location specific factors, such as the nature of the contamination, the soil type and the soil use. Responsible application of immobilizing agents therefore requires a coupling between research and application, in which: 

 l soil and vegetation are analyzed for (available) heavy metals; l to what extent and at what rate soil flora and fauna and the soil ecosystem recover; l to what extent heavy metals stil1wash out; l information is collected with which it wil1be possible to optimize the technique in the course of the remediation process (if necessary). 

 1.3.3 Philosophy 

 Immobilization of heavy metals in contaminated soils is a new technique without a proven track record. Its recognition as a sustainable method has to await the availability and evaluation of data obtained from its application in the field with special emphasis on the durability of the immobilization effect. The availability of a durable immobilization method wil1 of course not imply that the soil thus can be fdled up to the limit, or that such limits may be extended, just as the present-day policy is not that one can fill up the soil with heavy metals to its presently known ecological or legal limits.

beringite on Ni has not been described in the literature. Cu has to be immobilized under acid conditions, i.e. at pH 4.5 to 6, because Cu is mobilized by DOC in the soil solution at pH > 6. Both beringite with compost, and Alor All3-montmorillonite, and Mn-oxide can be used to immobilize Zn, Cd and Pb. This is summarized in table 1.

 2.3 Exampks of polluted locations ti The Netherlands 

 Figure 3 shows five locations in The Netherlands that are polluted with heavy metals. Both the total levels and the concentrations of the heavy metals in the soil solution have been measured for these locations. Table 2 shows the ratios between the heavy metal levels in these soils and the levels at which the Dutch law requires immediate action (the “intervention values”). Also given are the ratios between the concentrations in the soil solution and the concentrations at which the law would have required remedial action if the soil solution had been groundwater, i.e. the intervention values for the Maximum Acceptable Risk (MAR). This concerns values where 50% of the species in the soil ecosystem is no longer protected. Exceeding the intervention value should be cause for immediate action. 

 At two locations the heavy metal levels in the soil exceed the intervention values, namely Valkenswaard (for Zn and Cd) and Callantsoog (for Pb).^ An evaluation ba&^ on the concentrations of heavy metals in the soil solution however yields a different picture. At al1 fïve locations the concentrations of one or more of the metals exceed the intervention values, 


Figure 3. Exarnples ofheavy metal contaminated sites in The Netherlands. 

varying tiom 1.1 times the intervention value for Cu in Valkenswaard to 25 times the intervention value for Zn in Budel. These results beg the question whether in the future the evaluation of soil quality should be based on concentrations (of heavy metals) in the soil solution rather than on total contents.

(^) Ratios between total contents of heavy metals and intemention values for soils (le@ and ratios between concentrations of heavy metals in the soil solution and intenention values for groundwater (right) at live typical sites in The Netherlands (sampling depth 0-20 cm, except for Budel 0-5 cm; Janssen _et aZ.,_ 1996; AB-DLO, unpublished rest&). ‘. :^.^.^. .,; :‘.:&g :^ ‘:.‘;. ..’:.,.’ &j ..;. .-.,^ .:pG’;.;.1 .;, : Budel n.m. n.m. 0.4 0.2 n.m. n.m. n.m. 25 15 n.m.

Table 3 lîsts the metals that exceed the intervention values for groundwater in the aforementioned f!ive locations together with their source. Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb are the problem compounds. At these locations remediation by means of immobilizing agents would be worthwhile. An other advantage of the use of immobilizing agents is that heavy metals that may be deposited in the future fiom sources that remain active wil1 also be immobilized. The zinc smelter and the galvanizing facility at Mook are stil1 active. The heavy metals emissions fiom these works have undoubtedly been lowered due to environmental measures but whether they have been reduced to zero is unknown.

Four of them consist of a humic sandy soil, with a pH of **4.4** to 5.5. The fífth location has a humic clay soil with a pH of 5.5. At these pH values Zn, Cd, and Pb are quite soluble, so the pH of the soil has to be raised. Table 4. Soil type, pH and vegetation conditions of the contaminated sites (Janssen _et aZ.,_ 1996). ~~.~~.:~,:~~~:~.::.~..~.~.,::..‘:..~::i: ;.;:: ‘:: .,. : y.: ‘y ;; :.:....L;,’:‘,i:;.,::;.. .:,. .::‘...;,l.:.:.’ ;;::..:,.xegcQQ()n.:, :’ : :. 1 “: ‘::~::.,‘..‘:~.~~:,:.,~:.:,,$..,,,:. ,,. .,;‘. :::.:,..:::.:‘..:’‘. : .;;.:;:.Y.,f.{ Budel humic sand 1 48.^ drifting sand Woerden humic rich clay 58. grass Valkenswaard humic sand 55. grass at a river bank (The Dommel) Callantsoog humic sand 48. dunes with marram grass I^ Mook^ humic sand^44.^ grass Sand: C 8% clay; hght clay: 8% C clay <35%; heavy clay: > 35 % clay; hurk poor: < 2.5 %I organic matter; humic: 2.5% < organic matter C 15%; hurk rich > 15% organic matter; after Kuipers, 1984. 


The type of vegetation is of importante, because not al1 types of vegetation wil1 allow the practica1 application of immobilizing agents. In for example a thick forest the application of immobilizing agents wil1 be very troublesome. The type of vegetation in these fíve locations does not impede the use of immobilizing agents. The development of a vegetation cover on the sand dunes at Budel and Callantsoog after the application of immobilizing agents wil1 preclude further drifting and lateral dispersion of heavy metals by means of wind erosion. 

 At contaminated locations with a function allowing direct contact between contaminants and humans significant health risks wil1 exist. Such risks wil1 probably not be reduced sufficiently by the application of immobilizing agents to the contaminated soil. At e. g. a contaminated site in a residential area people can be exposed to elevated concentrations of heavy metals after ingestion of soil particles. Ingestion of soil particles is one of the most important routes by which humans, especially children, are exposed to contaminated soil. Heavy metals immobilized in soil particles can be remobilized in the stomach at low pH, thus causing health risks. The health risks of contaminated areas in residential areas must be assessed explicitly, before it can be evaluated whether the use of immobilizing agents at such locations is prudent. Table 5 lists the functions of the íïve locations, which vary between military training ground to traffic shoulder and nature area. For these functions it is to be exnected that direct contact between humans and contammants is minimal.

 2.3.2 Applicability of immobilizing agents at contaminated sites 

 In table 6 immobilization techniques are selected for the remediation of the five heavy metal contaminated locations. The objective of remediation is the achievement of risk reduction for the soil ecosystem and/or the reduction of the risk that the metals wil1 spread to the (ground)water. The^ expectation^ is^ that^ the^ application^ of^ the^ right immobilization technique results in a lower concentration of the heavy metals in the soil solution, and hence in risk reduction. Based on a literature survey of heavy metal immobilizing techniques, and knowledge of the behavior of heavy metals in the soil (see: appendix), the best choice would be to use beringite in combination with compost, 


 or Alor All3-montmorillonite or Mn-oxide in combination with lime for the locations Budel, Callantsoog, and Mook with pH values around 4.5.

 For the location Valkenswaard it is proposed to use beringite in combination with compost, or Al-montmorillonite in combination with lime. The resulting pH increase can however cause mobilization of Cu by dissolved organic carbon. Considering the Zn and Cd concentrations, exceeding the current intervention values by 9.5 and 15 times respectively, versus Cu by only 1.1, it is prudent to focus on Zn and Cd. On this location sampling was at a river bank, so there is a risk that the contaminated soil wil1 be flooded. This may cause reducing conditions. Reducing conditions wil1 cause dissolution of Mnoxide, thereby mobilizing heavy metals sorbed by Mn-oxide. Thus Mn-oxide should not be used at this site. At the location in Woerden, with pH 5.8, Alor ALmontmorillonite or Mn-oxide are the best choice to immobilize Cu. 

 Table 7 gives the amounts of the various immobilizing agents hao necessary to remediate the upper 30 cm of a contaminated soil. Immobilizing agents are applied by means of a rotary cultivator reaching a depth of about 30 to 35 cm. This limits the applicability of immobilizing agents thus to the upper soil layers. For al1 contaminated areas more than one immobilization technique is proposed. The choice between the techniques wil1 have to be made on the basis of their effectiveness and of the durability of the effects, but the costs also play a role. To give an indication of the costs of beringite: the price amounts to Hfl 300,= 1000 kg-‘,^ so an^ a^ mof^ 110 ton haw1(table 7) amounts too^ u^ n^ t 


Hfl33,OOO, = ha? These costs are an order of magnitude lower than the costs of removing the contaminants by excavating the polluted soil. There is a need for additional research in order to test the effectiveness and durability of proposed immobilization techniques in the field. Additional research wil1 yield knowledge and insight that can contribute to a successful application of these techniques for the remediation of contaminated soils. In The Netherlands such research is being carried out at the DLOResearch Institute for Agrobiology and Soil Fertility (AB-DLO) and at the Agricultural University in Wageningen.

### 1 l Introduction 

**1.1 Heavy metals in soil** 

Heavy metals, such as Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb, are ubiquitous natural soil constituents. Table 1.1 shows an indication of background levels of heavy metals in Dutch soil, which range between 0.1400 mg kg-‘.

As an example the Zn content may become as high as 5000 mg kg-’ as measured at the site of a metalliferous smelting industry (Slooff _et al,_ 1989). Besides atmospheric deposition, other diffise sources such as fertilizer, manure and sewage sludge amendements and point sources such as industrial and municipal waste dunq#ng grounds contribute to the heavy metal laad of SOL Obviously, not al1 of these sources contribute a similar **amount** of heavy metals to al1 soils. Pollution of soil with heavy metals is a general point of concern, because heavy metals may adversely affect soil ecology, agricultural production or product quality and (ground)water quality, and because of a lack of realistic and cost-effective techniques for the remediation of such soils. Normally, the mobility of heavy metals in soil is low. Heavy metals are removed only slowly by leaching, plant uptake or erosion. In contrast to organic micro-pollutants, heavy metals can not be biodegraded. Therefore, pollution of soil with heavy metals appears to be persistent (KabataPendias & Pendias, 1992). Adverse effects of heavy metals in soil are related to their bioavailability and mobility, which are controlled by the speciation. The chemical form of heavy metals is determined by the physico-chemical soil conditions such as soil type, pH and cation exchange capacity: CEC) (figure 1.1). Due to changes in land use, the physico-chemical conditions may be altered: e.g. nature development on former agricultural land wil1 result in a lower pH 


 Appendix: Review of recent literature on heavy metal immobilization in soils 

(Hesterberg, 1993; Japenga et _al.,_ 1997). A low pH may increase the bioavailability and mobility of heavy metals in soil. Thus, pollution of soil with heavy metals exhibits riks to the soil ecolcgy, agriculture and (ground)water quality, and poses the question of remediation. The answer to this question depends upon the extent of the pollution problem and the technical and fínancial means available.

Heavy metals in the soil. **1.2 Traditional soil remediation techniques** The most comprehensive remediation technique is to excavate polluted soil and replace it by unpolluted material. On a large scale, however, this is nat feasible due to the high costs involved, the problems related to the safe disposal of the polluted material and the limited availability of clean soil for replacement. Other remediation techniques are in S~IUor ei _sim_ clean-up of polluted soil by chemical or physico-chemical techniques, which extract or remove the heavy metals from the soil. The clean soil can be reintroduced at the original site or disposed elsewhere (Vangronsveld _et aZ.,_ 1994a). However, new problems can arise such as an increase of the bioavailability and mobility of the remaining heavy metals in the treated soil, the disposal of polluted process agents or rests (resins, sludges, etc.) and changes in the physico-chemical conditions of the soil decreasing its potential to be used as normal soil (Van Gestel _et aZ.,_ 1988). An altemative technique is the in _situ_ immobilization of pollution by using heavy metal immobilizing additives.

 1.3 h sí& immobilization 

IIZsìtu irnmobilization can be an economically realistic and cost-effective technique for the reduction of risks imposed by heavy metal polluted soil. _I’ situ_ immobilization means that heavy metals are not extracted tiom the polluted soil, but remain immobilized in the soil so that the heavy metals irnpose no risks to the soil ecology, agriculture and (ground)water quality. Immobilization of heavy metals can be achieved by decreasing the concentration in the soil solution or by increasing the soil sorption capacity (Krebs, 1996). Several immobilization techniques have been reported in literature (e.g. Lothenbach et d., 1997; Vangronsveld et d., 1995a). Lime, phosphate and olivine decrease the heavy metal concentration in the soil solution due to an increasing pH and/or the formation of slightly soluble precipitates, whereas clay minerals, manganese oxides and organic matter increase the sorption capacity. Figure 1.2 shows the _in sits_ immobilization techniques, which may be useful for reducing the riks posed by soil polluted with heavy metals.

### 2 0 Soil chemistry of heavy metals 

**2.1 Speciation of heavy metals** 

The speciation of heavy metals can be defined as the chemical farms in which they can exist. Figure 2.1 shows an overview of the main forms of heavy metals in soil. Heavy metals are distributed among several phases and fractions depending on the physico-chemical conditions of the soil. Two soil phases of major importante are the solid and the solution phase. 

Figure 2.1_ Distribution of heavy metals in soil (atier Römkens _et al.,_ 1993). 

Solid phuse Three main fkactions of heavy metals are distinguished within the solid phase (Shuman, 199la; Stevenson, 1994): 

l sorbed; l as secondary precipitates (precipitates of dissolved minerals, e.g. PbCO3); l in primary soil minerals. 

Sorption can be defined as all interactions between dissolved heavy metals and the solid phase causing an accumulation of heavy metals at the surface of the soil particles. Sorption does not include precipitation. Usually the sorbed fraction is the smallest. Nevertheless, it is considered to be the most reactive. Dissolution of heavy metals from secondary precipitates and primary minerals is slow compared to sorption and desorption. Therefore, the equilibrium between heavy metals in the solid and the solution phase is hardly affected by these fractions (Shuman, 199lb). The main sorbents are clay minerals, oxides and organic matter. Clay minerals and other inorganic surfaces can be coated and intercalated with organic matter and oxides, forming additional sorption sites (Sposito, 1989). 

 Solutionphase The solution phase is the most important one in the soil, although it contains only a small fraction of the total heavy metal content. It is the main determinant of plant availability and the amounts of heavy metals which can be leached to lower soil horizons and the 


 Appendix: Review of recent literature on heavy metal immobilization in soils 

groundwater. The speciation of heavy metals in the solution phase is important, because it affects toxicity. The toxicity of heavy metals generally decreases with an increasing degree of complexation. Plants predominantly take up heavy metals in the free ionic form (Pain, 1995). Three main fractions are distinguished within the solution phase (Shuman, 199la; Stevenson, 1994): 

 l free heavy metal ions; l complexes with inorganic ligands; l complexes with organic ligands (both dissolved and colloidal). 

Important ligands forming stable complexes in the soil solution are: Cl*, OH-, POd3-,COs2and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC). 

 2.2 Soil parameters 

 The distribution of heavy metals among the several phases distinguished within the soil is determined by physico-chemical soil parameters affecting processes such as sorption and desorption, complexation and precipitation and dissolution of heavy metals. Important physico-chemical soil parameters in this respect are the pH and the CEC. 

 2.2.1 pH 

 Betering capaciq The pH mainly depends on the prevailing pH buffering mechanism in the soil. The buffering capacity is an expression of the ability of the soil to resist chemically to a varying pH. Table 2.1 shows the pH buffering mechanisms in SOL The clay mineral and organic matter content are of major importante for determining the buffering capacity. Non-calcareous sandy soils with a low clay mineral and organic matter content have a low buffering capacity. When there is a net input of H+ due to acidic atmospheric deposition, these soils can acidify rapidly. Changes in land use may cause the soil to acidi@. Johnston et aZ.(1986) measured a decrease of the pH from 7 to 4.2 over a period of 100 years when formerly limed agricultural land was changed into deciduous forest.

_Proton exchunge on variable charge sopion sites_ Hydroxyl groups (ZZ-OH)and carboxylic (R-COOH) and phenolic hydroxyl groups (ZZ-OH) of organic matter can be protonated or deprotonated by sorption or desorption of H+, as shown for a hydroxyl group by: 

Z&OH + H+ R-OH2+ R-OH _R-O+_ H+ 

After deprotonation, positively charged free heavy metal ions or partially complexed heavy metals can sorb to the negatively charged sites. Sorption of heavy metals involving proton exchange on variable charge sites is dependent on pH. Several studies (e.g. McKenzie, 1980) indeed demonstrated that sorption of heavy metals decreased at lower pH values. Figure 2.2 shows the influence of pH on sorption of Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb to the iron oxide goethite. 20 

 2 4 6. 8 PH 

 Figure 2.2. Sorption of heavy metals on the iron oxide goethite (after McKenzie, 1980). 

 Sorption of cations on variable charge sites can be due to either cation exchange or covalent binding. Cation exchange involves electrostatic forces causing attraction between the distinct negatively charged sites and the positively charged heavy metal ions (R-01. -IS’, RBCOO

_.._ .Na+). The sorbed cations are readily exchangeable. Covalent binding involves a chemically specific interaction _(&O~Cu~O~R)._ The sorbed cations are hardly exchangeable and specific sorption sites do, therefore, not contribute to the CEC of soil or soil constituent. Cations all have a different affínity for the formation of a covalent binding. Based on electronegativity (Pauling), the predicted affínity order of divalent cations for oxides is: Cu2+> Ni2’ > Pb2+> Cd2+> Zn2+(McBride, 1994). 


 Appendix: Review of recent literature on heavy metal immobilization in soik 

**2.2.2 Cation exchange capacity** 

The CEC is defined as the sum of exchangeable cations that a soil or a soil constituent can sorb at a specific pH (Spa&, 1995). The CEC of a soil is mainly determined by the clay mineral, oxide, and organic matter content. An increase in either of these soil constituents results in an increase of the CEC (Sposito, 1989). 

Clay minerals of major importante in soil are montmorillonites, vermiculites, illites and kaolinites. They exhibit a varying composition and structure, but all are aluminosilicates. Table 2.2 shows some physico-chemical characteristics of these clay minerals. The specific surface area and CEC decrease in (Stevenson, 1994).

The variable negative charge is located at the edge-sites of the clay minerals, where hydroxyl groups are protonated or deprotonated depending on pH. The CEC of clay minerals increases with pH because of deprotonation of hydroxyl groups. Due to the permanent negative charge, electrostatic forces cause attraction of positively charged heavy metal ions resulting in a layer at the boundary of the clay mineral surface and the solution phase hom which negative ions are expelled and positive ions are accumulated, i.e. the diffuse double layer. The sorbed cations are readily exchanged by ether cations such as Mg+ or Ca2+(Van Bladel _et aZ.,_ 1993), but also H+ may compete for the cation exchange sites resulting in a further pH dependency of heavy metal sorption in soil. Figure 2.3 shows Co sorption by various soil constituents. Montmorillonite sorbs a larger amount of Co (on weight basis) than illite does. Furthermore, figure 2.3 shows that bimessite (a Mn-oxide) and humic acid sorb a larger amount of Co tiom solution than montmorillonite does.

_Oxides_ Al-, Mnand Fe-oxides are nnportant in the chemistry of the soil. Although oxides are nat present in large amounts, they have a significant effect on various soil chemical processes, because of their high specific surface area and reactivity. The general term oxides refers to hydroxides, oxyhydroxides and hydrous oxides (where non-stoichiometric water is in the structure). Oxides are commonly present in the soil as minerals or as surface coatings on other (in)organic surfaces, and have a low solubility in _the normal_ pH range of the soil. Generally heavy metals are sorbed either by cation exchange or by covalent binding, but isomorphous substitution may also contribute to immobilization of heavy metals by oxides.

 Organic matter In sandy soil with a low clay content (~5% clay), up to 90% of the CEC may be attributed to organic matter (Sposito, 1989; Stevenson, 1994). Soil organic matter mainly occurs as non-soluble and stable humic substances sorbed to the solid phase. The most important functional groups for heavy metal sorption are carboxylic and phenolic hydroxyl groups. The CEC increases at higher pH values resulting íkom the formation of additional sorption sites. The proton dissociation constants (pK.i) for carboxylic and phenolic hydroxyl groups range between respectively 4.4-4.9 and 8.1-8.9 (Römkens et aZ., 1996), i.e. 50% of the respective tictional groups exists in the dissociated form at pH 4.4-4.9 and 8.1-8.9. Multivalent cations (Cu*+, Zn2’, etc.) have the potential to form covalent bindings with the functional groups (Stevenson, 1994). Table 2.3 shows the order of afEn@ of divalent cations for soil organic matter related to electronegativity.

Table 2.3. (^) Measured order of afkity of divalent cations for soil organic matter related to electronegativity (McBride, 1994). Dìssolved orgunìc carbon The amount of DOC in the soil solution is determined by physico-chemical parameters such as pH and the Ca2’ concentration and may range tiom 0-100 mg l-’ (Römkens et al., 1996). Several studies (e.g. Davis, 1984) demonstrated that DOC can increase the solubility and mobility of heavy metals. The DOC competes with the solid phase for heavy metal complexation. This may cause a mobilization of heavy metals such as Cu, exhibiting a high affmity for sorbing to DOC. From the Cu concentration in the soil solution 70 to almost 100 per cent can be in the organically complexed form (Hodgson et **_aZ.,_** 1965). Due to complexation to DOC, the net positive charge of a heavy met& decreases compared to the free ionic farm. Thereby, the electrostatic attraction between the complexed heavy metal and the predominantly negatively charged soil surface decreases. This causes the heavy metal to become increasingly mobile in SOL The complexed heavy metal can be transported to the lower soil horizons and groundwater. Whether the complexed heavy metal remains in solution or is sorbed by the solid phase depends on the local pH and organic matter content. Thus, solid organic matter can decrease the mobility of heavy metals in soil. By DOC in the contrary it can be increased.

### 3 0 In sti immobilization 

In sits immobilization of heavy metals in the soil can be achieved by decreasing the concentration in the soil solution or by increasing the sorption capacity (Krebs, 1996). Reported techniques aiming to decrease the solution concentration by increasing pH and/or causing precipitation are the addition of lime, phosphate and olivine, whereas techniques aiming to increase the sorption capacity are the addition of beringite, montmorillonite, Mnoxide, gravel sludge, and brown coal. 

 3.1 Tecbniques aiming to increase pH ador cause precipitation 

 3.1.1 Lime 

 Liming (Cao) of slightly acidic soils is a common practice in agriculture to compensate for acidification resulting from the amendment of fertilizers and the natural process of leaching, in order to maintain a pH of about 4.5-6.0 for an optimal crop growth. Lime can react chemically to compensate for a high concentration of H+, as is shown by the following reactions: 

 Ca0 (s) + HZO + Ca(OH)z 

 Ca(OH)z + 2H+ + 2H20 + Ca2+ 

 Liming may cause immobilization of heavy metals in soil, because of the formation of additional sorption sites and precipitation of heavy metals as hydroxides at higher pH values. 

 Hydroqhtion The use of lime to increase pH causing dissolved heavy metals to precipitate as slightly soluble hydroxides is a common cleanup technology in waste-water treatment (De Boodt, 1991). The hydroxylation of a hydrated heavy metal in water at neutral pH values can be described by: 

 Zn2+~(H20)~e Zn(OH)+~@O)~ + H’ 

 The equilibrium of the hydroxylation reaction can be described by the dissociation constant log l&, of which the negative logarithm is the pk&. Table 3.1 shows the pl& values of Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. The pk& valse of a heavy metal is the pH leve1 at which 50% of the concentration is present as a hydrated cation and the ether 50% as a cation hydroxide complex. The lower the pI& value of a heavy metal, the lower the pH wil1 be at which it precipitates.

The effect of liming was not sufficient to reach normal Zn and Cd contents in spinach leaves, because the contents still exceeded the values considered as phytotoxic (Kabata Pendias & Pendias, 1992). Thus, liming only partially decreased the risks of causing environmental effects of heavy metals. 

_Heavy metal sohbili~_ Marschner _et al._ (1995) added 0.3 % lime (on weight basis) to a sewage sludge amended humic sandy soil polluted with Cu, Zn and Cd. By liming the pH increased from 5.3 to 6.3. Table 3.5 shows the water-extractable heavy metal contents of the (un)limed soil. Liming decreased the Zn and Cd contents by about 60.80%, whereas the Cu content only decreased by 30%. Immobilization of Zn and Cd was probably due to the increased sorption capacity of the soil.

Liming increased the total heavy metal content by <40%, because the lime was contaminated with heavy metals (5 mg Ni, 28 mg Cu, 51 mg Zn and 0.3 mg Cd kg-‘). The pH increased fkom 55.4 to 6.1-6.3. Table 3.6 shows the (0.1 M) NaNO3-extractable Cu, Zn and Cd contents in the upper 20 cm of the (un)limed soil. The Zn and Cd contents decreased to below 0.1 mg kg-‘, whereas _Cu was_ hardly affected. The Zn and Cd contents in the subsoil (20-40 cm) also decreased, but the Cu content increased from 0.05 to 0.07 mg kg? This slight increase can be caused by the elevated organic matter content of the limed soil, which may function as a source for dissolved/colloidal organic ligands with the increased pH, resulting in the formation of soluble Cu-DOC complexes. Thus, liming effectively immobilized Zn and Cd in soil, but mobilized rather than immobilized Cu by DOC complexation. Table 3.6.

Liming does not increase the total number of sorption sites, but only increases the affinity of the sorption sites. This effect may not be sufficient for sorbing all heavy metals in the soil solution of a polluted soil. Therefore, other techniques increasing the total sorption capacity may have more potential for treating polluted soil. The effect of liming on heavy metal immobilization will only be temporary. When there is a net input of H+, the lime dissolves, counteracting the acidification of the soil. Therefore, depending on soil type and external acid input, liming has to be repeated every year or every 5 years. This should not be a problem when the costs of liming are sufficiently low. 

 3.1.2 Phosphate 

 The interest in the use of phosphate minerals for treating soils polluted with heavy metals mainly exists in urban environments in the United States of America (USA). The research group of Q.Y. Ma (Universiq of Florida, Gainesville, USA) conducted several studies on the use of phosphate minerals for the immobilization of heavy metals. These studies concentrated on Pb, because of the Pb toxicity to the ecosystem and human beings and the numerous Pb polluted sites, resulting fkom large scale use of Pb in paints and the widespread Ph emission by traffic. 

 Precipitation Precipitation is a chemical reaction affecting the speciation of inorganic minerals in soil, because it removes solutes from the soil solution through the formation of new solid phases. Precipitation only occurs when supersaturation exists in the soil solution; i.e. the soil solution contains more solutes than should be present at equilibrium. At undersaturation the solid phases will dissolve. In non-polluted soils solutions are usually undersaturated and precipitation of dissolved heavy metals is not likely to occur (McBride, 1994). However, in soils polluted with heavy metals, the soil solution may become saturated to a level supporting precipitation of new solid phases. Phosphate can be added to remove the heavy metals from the soil solution. Slightly soluble phosphate minerals of heavy metals may form, thereby immobilizing the pollutants and decreasing bioavailability. Precipitation may, however, not be able to remove enough of the heavy metals from the soil solution to restore the natural background concentrations and reference values. At equilibrium, the heavy metal concentrations maintained by the dissolution of the phosphate minerals may still be significantly high. The equilibrium of a dissolution reaction of a solid phase is described by the reaction product log &, of which the negative logarithm is the ph. Table 3.7 shows the equilibrium reactions of the dissolution of phosphate minerals, the respective p& values, and the heavy metal equilibrium concentrations. The heavy metal concentrations were calculated at a HzPO4-concentration of 0.4 mg 10’and pH 5. The value 0.4 mg 10’is the reference value for total inorganic phosphate in groundwater of sandy soil in the Netherlands; the reference value of clay and peat soil is 3 mg 1-l (Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment, 1991). There are^ no reference^ values for total

inorganic phosphate in the soil solution. At these conditions, the concentrations of Pb in equilibrium with hydroxypyromorphite (Pbs(PO+OH) and fluoropyromorphite (Pbs(PO+F) and of Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd in equilibrium with their phosphate minerals are significantly higher than the intervention values. Therefore, the formation of these heavy metal phosphate minerals does not have potential for treating polluted soil at the given reference values in The Netherlands. Only the concentration of Pb in equilibrium with chloropyromorphite (Pb$PO+Cl) is lower than the reference value.

 is lower than this value. At pH values higher than 6, the4 o P 2 H concentration in solution would be lower. However, at pH 6, the4 o P 2 H concentration at which the Pb concentration is sufficiently low would significantly exceed the Dutch reference value for total inorganic phosphate in groundwater. In The Netherlands, this would be unacceptible for policy makers. To provide an indication of the amounts of phosphate being used for in situ Pb remediation, Yang Ed uZ. (1997) added as much as 1% H3PO4 (on weight basis) to a Pb polluted soil. This amount is about 15 times higher than the average total phosphate content of a Dutch agricultural soil. A high phosphate concentration in the soil solution can support transport of phosphate by lateral (sub)surface runoff and/or drainage tiles to surface waters, where it may cause eutrophication. This should be avoided, because it causes effects in various aquatic ecosystems: e.g. mass algal growth and dominance of cyanobacteria in lakes, increase of algal biomass in ditches, increased occurrence of nuisance algae and oxygen depletion in the North Sea (Boers et aZ., 1995). Therefore, the use of phosphate for treating Pb polluted soil does not have much potential in The Netherlands.

 lke use ofphosphute in the USA In the USA, the technique of immobilizing Pb using phosphate is being further developed for remediating urban soils, as an alternative for excavation of the soil (Pierzynski, 1997). The local authorities do not accept a techniques, which only increase the sorption capacity. Instead, Pb has to be converted into another binding form, for which Pb phosphate nkerals

were selected. In feeding studies with pigs, it was found that Pb-phosphate minerals were taken up to a lesser extent than Pb in soil samples. It is assumed that the same will occur after ingestion of soil by humans. It is accepted by the authorities that the Pb concentration of the soil solution can be even higher after addition of phosphates. 

3.1.3 OIiviue 

Olivine is a magnesiurniron silicate, which is known as the most rapidly weathering primary mineral thereby consuming H’. It can be added to highly acidic soils to reach a less acidic pH. The chemical composition of olivine is [Mgz, Fti]SiOd, whereby Mg dominates over Fe. Olivine is able to react chemically consuming H+, as is shown by the following reactions (X denotes Mg or Fe): 

 XBiO4 + 4H+ + 2X2+ + SiO2 +2H20 

 2MgzSiO4 + 2H+ + H20 + Mg&O5(OH)4 + Mg+ The costs of the use of olivine will be low. It is mined in Norway and the northern part of Spain. Olivine is used in the steel industry. It is slightly contaminated with Ni, i.e. 3 mg kg-’ (De1 Castilho, 1997). 

 Dissolution mte The dissolution rate of olivine mainly depends on the pH and pCO2, and the presence of microcracks on the grains (Wogelius & Walther, 1990; 1992). Obviously, the dissolution rate increases at lower pH values. The pCO2 affects the dissolution rate, as is shown by the reaction (X denotes Mg or Fe): 

 2XBiO4 + CO2 + 2H20 + XGO5(OH)4 + XC03 

 The dissolution rate is also promoted by small grain sizes and the presence of micro-cracks on the grains because of the higher specific surface area. 

 pH Buteting The pH buffering effect of olivine in soil is as yet not well investigated. It is expected that an addition of a ton of olivine ha-’ to a highly acidic soil with pH 3 will increase the pH to about 4 (De1 Castilho, 1997). According to calculations of Jonckbloedt (unpublished), a soil of pH 3 will be buffered for a considerable period of time. Table 3.10 shows maximum pH buffering periods for different scenarios by varying grainsize, rainwater pH and dosage. The results are tentative, because the parameter pCO2 was not taken into account.

 Usejidness Olivine may be useful for forest and nature areas for maintaining a slightly acidic pH. In The Netherlands, large forest and nature areas consist of noncalcareous soil with a low clay and organic matter content and, thus, having a low pH buffering capacity. Due to a net input of H+, the pH of these soils can decrease to 3-4. In this pH range, Al phytotoxicity and leaching to the groundwater can become a problem. Buffering of pH at about 4 by olivine is expected to prevent the Al problem. In this case, lime is not an alternative to olivine. In nature areas consisting of acidic and poor sandy soils, a vegetation adapted to these conditions has developed, and liming would cause this natural vegetation to disappear, because of a higher nutrient availability resulting f?om the increased rate of mineralization of organic matter at higher pH. 

 Another potential application of olivine is in the preventive treatment of poor, generally sandy, agricultural soils. A substantial part of these soils is in the process of being converted into nature areas. Here, stopping the normal agricultural practice of liming will result in a decrease in the pH of the soil, and thus in solubilization of a large fraction of the heavy metals present in these soils as a result of past applications of manure and fertilizers. Addition of olivine can help to maintain the pH of these soils at values that are high enough to preclude solubilization and mobilization of heavy metals. Field experiments to test this scenario are presently being discussed (De1Castilho, 1997). 

 Olivine does not have potential for treating heavy metal polluted soil. It buffers the pH in the acid range, limiting the risks associated with Al, but without sufficiently decreasing the risks of heavy metal toxicity and leaching. However, laboratory and field experiments with olivine are necessary for testing its ability to limit Al phytotoxicity and leaching. 


 Appendix: Review of recent literature on heavy metal immobilization in soils 

**3.2 Techniques aiming to increase the sorption capacity of the soil** 

3.2.1 **Beringite** 

The aluminosilicate beringite is a coal mining residue. It **is** a product of the fluidized bed burning of mine pile material (mainly schists and coal) originating from a former coal mine at Beringen in Belgium. The minerals present in the schists are quartz, phyllosilicates (illite, kaolin&e and chlorite), calcite (CaCO$ dolomite ([Ca, Mg]COs), anhydrite (CaSOe), siderite (FeCO3) and pyrite (Fe&). The schists are pulverized by heating in an electrically guided fluidized bed oven at about 8OO’C. During the heating process, the schists are partly broken down and partly recrystalized resulting in the modified clay mineral beringite. The element composition is similar to the original schists. Particles with a medium diameter of 0.02-0.2 mm are separated by air suction (De Boodt, 1991). Table 3.11 shows the average chemical composition of beringite in which SiOz and Al203 are the main tiactions. Beringite is contaminated with heavy metals from the coal mining residue, which may decrease its acceptance by policy makers when used for treatment of polluted soil. However, the contaminants are strongly sorbed by beringite as indicated by a solubihty experiment of De Boo& (1991).

 Mechanism of fonnution The mechanism of formation of beringite is well understood. There is a method to produce a less polluted product by heating calcareousmarine clay with fly ash at a ratio of 911 (on weight basis) up to 800-850°C. Fly ash is added because of the high Fe0 and Fe~(hcontent providing specific sorption sitesl The minimum CaO content will amount to about 4.3%, which is higher than in beringiteAdditional calcite can be added to increase 


 Appendix: Review of recent literature on heavy metal immobilization in soils 

 the CaO content. Thus, the production of a comparable, but less polluted agent is not really a problem. 

_Mechanism of immbilization_ Beringite has a high potential for heavy metal immobilization in soil, although the mechanism is not yet completely understood. It may affect the soil pH, the CEC and specific sorption capacity (e.g. SiOH, AlOH), but also lead to (co-)precipitation of heavy metals. The specific surface area and CEC of beringite are respectively 20 m* gW1and 16-22 cmolc kg-’ (at pH _7) (De_ Boodt, 1991). These values may be considered as low. Beringite induces a strong alkaline reaction. The pH can become as high as 12.5. The high pH is due to the presence of MgO and CaO formed during the heating of CaCO3 and Ka. MglCO3. CaO and MgO will dissolve when reacting with Hz0 forming Ca(OH)z. The dissolution of Mg(OH)z and Ca(OH)z will leads to an increase of the soil pH.

_Leaching of heavy metals in a pot eqwtiment_ The research group of J. Vangronsveld (University of Limburg, Diepenbeek, Belgium) has conducted several studies on the effectiveness of beringite for the immobilization of heavy metals in the soil. Vangronsveld & _aZ._ (1995a) studied the effect on heavy metal leaching of the addition of 5 % beringite (on weight basis) to a bare soil, the effect of a plant cover of the heavy metal tolerant grasses _Agrostis capiZZaris_ and _Festuca rzdka_ without beringite addition, and the effect of 5% beringite addition together with a plant cover. The soil was sampled Tom the site of a former metallurgical zinc smelter in Belgium, and was characterized as an acidic sandy soil low in organic matter and heavily polluted with Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. Table 3.12 shows the effects of the treatments on the Zn and Cd concentrations in the water leached through the soil profile and the total amounts of Zn and Cd transported. Beringite reduces the Zn and Cd concentrations in the leachate by 70-75 %, the plant cover alone only by 50%. However, beringite significantly increased the amount of water leached out of the soil, which caused the total amounts of Zn and Cd moved to decrease only by 40.50%. The plant cover on the other hand restricted the amount of water leached, reducing the total amounts of Zn and Cd moved by about 85 %. Thus revegetation as such already strongly decreased leaching of heavy metals out of the soil. Revegetation also reduces lateral transport of heavy metal containing topsoil by wind erosion. 

 . 

 Nevertheless, Vangronsveld et aL (1995a) concluded that to decrease the heavy metal problem in these soils, beringite may be helptil for reducing phytotoxicity when necessary for a successfil revegetation, because beringite lowers the concentration of heavy metals like Zn and Cd in the soil solution.

 Phytotoxkity The soil sampled from the above zinc smelter was highly phytotoxic. The results of a biological investigation by Van Assche & Clijsters (1990) demonstrated that the phytotoxicity of the soil decreased after the addition of 5% beringite (on weight basis) (Vangronsveld et aZ., 1995b). It is based on the analysis of some morphological (shoot length, weight, leaf area) and biochemical (induction of stress-enzyme capacity and modification of isoenzyme patterns) parameters of test plants grown in soil under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Morphological and biochemical parameters of non-tolerant test plants (Phaseohs vuZgati,s) grown in untreated soil were highly affected. Beringite prevented morphological and biochemical damages and decreased the Zn and Cd contents by about 80% (table 3.13). However, the Zn content of the plants grown in treated soil still exceeds the value considered as phytotoxic by Kabata-Pendias & Pendias (1992).

the vegetation cover. Because of soil phytotoxicity, the naturzil heather and grass vegetation had completely disappeared from this area. About 120 tons of beringite and 100 tons of compost ha-’ (respectively 2 and 1.5% on weight basis) were added to the upper 35 cm of the soil. Compost can help to overcome the plant nutrient deficiency, to improve the water retention capacity of the soil, and to increase the total sorption capacity. The tests with _P. vdgaris_ demonstrated that the phytotoxicity of the treated soil decreased after 4 weeks of equilibration. Typical features of phytotoxicity such as extreme growth inhibition and induction of stress (iso-enzymes) as observed in _P. vzdgatis grown in_ untreated soil did not show up any more and heavy metal contents in plants decreased significantly. After the treatment a seed mixture of commercially available cultivars of heavy metal and drought tolerant A. _capiZZar-3_ (10%) and F. _mbra_ (65 %) supplemented with non-tolerant _L&m perenne_ (25%) was sown. Because of the .amendements phytotoxicity of the soil was limited as indicated by the fruitful development of a vegetation cover immediately after sowing. The vegetation cover became fully estiblished after 16 weeks.

 Durabiliv of in situ immobilisation by beringite To be a useful technique, in situ immobilization of heavy metals in soil has to last for a considerable period of time. Wessolek &zFahrenhorst (1994) calculated long-term leaching of Zn and Cd with a numerical simulation model after the addition of beringite. The simulation indicated an effective immobilization of Zn and Cd by the solid phase during 80 years. 

 Vangronsveld et aZ. (1996) studied in situ the physico-chemical soil conditions, phytotoxicity, floristic and fungal diversity and mycorrhizal infection of the plant community five years after the application of beringite and compost at the site already discussed. Table 3.15 shows the pH, organic matter content, CEC and water-extractable Zn concentration before and after the treatment. The untreated soil exhibited an acidic pH, a low organic matter content and CEC, a high water-soluble Zn content and a high phytotoxicity. Five years after 


 Appendix: Review of recent literature on heavy metal immobilization in soils 

the treatment, the pH, organic matter content and CEC had increased significantly. The water-extractable Zn content had decreased by > 98%. The phytotoxicity was still comparable to the level measured 4 weeks after the treatment as demonstrated by the biological tests. The vegetation was still healthy and regenerating by vegetative means and seed. The floristic and mngal diversity of the treated soil was higher than that of the untreated soil. The ubiquity of the mycorrhizal fungi in plant roots demonstrated that a functioning ecosystem was establishing. 

 Vangronsveld et d. (1996) did not provide results of the water-extractable Cu, Cd and Pb contents and DOC concentration. The increased organic matter content may function as a source for DOC. Cu exhibits a high afkity for complexation with DOC. Cu may be mobilized by DOC in the pH range of the treated soil, due to the formation of soluble CuDOC complexes (R&&ens et aZ., 1996). However, Famworth et aZ. (1996) demonstrated that beringite is able to sorb DOC. Therefore, beringite may immobilize soluble heavy metal=DOC complexes, although its sorption capacity for DOC is low.

 3.2.2 Montmorillonite 

 Montmorillonite may have potential for heavy metal immobilization in soil, because it has a large specific surface area and a high CEC. Heavy metals mainly sorb on montmorillonite by electrostatic attraction. They can, therefore, be readily exchanged for other cations such as Mg’ and Ca2+ (Van Blade1 et aZ., 1993). Sorption of heavy metals can be improved by the addition of Al. The Al-hydroxide groups compensate part of the permanent negative charge of the clay mineral. Thus, the sorption of heavy metals due to CEC is smaller than on the untreated montmorillonite. The loss of CEC is, however, more than offset by the formation of surface hydroxyl groups providing specific sorption sites located at the surface of the Al-hydroxide coatings (Lothenbach et d., 1997). Specific sorption sites can also 


 Appendix: Review of recent literature on heavy metal immobikation in soils 

be provided by the polynuclear aluminum complex A~O~AII~(OH)~@I~O)I~~’referred to as Al13. Deprotonation of the Al~-H20 ligands forms hydroxyl groups with a high affinity for heavy metal complexation (Janssen, 1995). The sorbent All3-montmorillonite can be formed fkom the addition of Ah3 to montrnorillonite. Table 3.16 shows the specific surface area and CEC of the sorbents.

_Montmmillonite_ Lothenbach _et al._ (1997) added montmorillonite to aqueous solutions of Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. In the pH range 4-7, montmorillonite sorbed only 20% of the heavy metals. Sorption further increased at pH >7, due to a decrease of the competition effect between heavy metals and H+, and the increasing importance of hydroxylation at a pH of about the pl!& values of the heavy metals. All heavy metals sorbed were considerably remobilized after the addition of an excess of Ba indicating that these heavy metals were readily exchangeable. Because of the risks of remobilization, immobilization of heavy metals in soil.

 Ah and Aland Almmtmorillonite Lothenbach et al. (1997) added Al13and Aland All3-montmorillonite to aqueous solutions of Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. Heavy metal sorption by Al13and Aland All3-montmorillonite was pH dependent. Sorption increased to 100% at pH values above 6, due to the formation of additional sorption sites resulting fkom the deprotonation of hydroxyl groups and Al~Hz0 ligands. The polynuclear aluminum complex Al13formed soluble complexes with Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb in the pH range 5.8-6.1. Thus, Al13may cause mobilization of heavy metals rather than immobilization and does, therefore, not have potential for soil remediation. Table 3.17 shows the pH ranges in which Aland Allj-montmorillonite sorbed heavy metals. Ni, Cu and Zn were sorbed by specific sites, because the addition of Ba did not show significant remobilization. Thus, other cations in the soil solution would hardly affect sorption, because these heavy metals are not exchangeable. In contrast, Cd was readily exchanged, whereas Pb was partially remobilized.

_Aluminum toxicity In_ using Al-montmorillonite for soil remediation, the question of Al toxicity becomes important. The most toxic aluminum species are Al(OH)*+ and Al(OH)z’ (Marschner, 1995). A solubility experiment of Al-montmorillonite in water by Lothenbach _et aZ._ (1998) demonstrated that the dissolved Al concentration was below 0.5 mg 1-lin the pH range 50 8.5. The solubility of Al in soil mainly is determined by pH. At pH values above 5.5, the soil solution contains an Al concentration of about 0.4 mg l-’ which is not considered as toxic for plants (Kabata-Pendias & Pendias, 1992; Marschner, 1995). Thus, the addition of Almontmorillonite to soil in the pH range of 5.5 and 8.5 is not likely to be toxic. High toxicity is also attributed to the polynuclear cation Al13’+(Parker _et aZ.,_ 1989). However, results on the solubility of Allj-montmorillonite are lacking. 

 Table 3.18. NaNO3-extractable heavy metal contents (mg kg-’ on dry weight basis) in untreated soil and in soil treated with 5 or 60 g montmorillonite or Al-montmorillonite kg-l soil (Lothenbach et aZ., 1998).

 Usejidness Montmorillonite and Aland Ah-montmorillonite effectively immobilized Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. Because the heavy metals sorbed by montmorillonite were readily exchangeable this mineral it may have less potential for soil remediation though. Aland Ah3-montmorillonite hardly have cation exchange sites. Thus, sorption of heavy metals would not be affected by other cations in the soil solution, and they probably would not affect nutrient availability for plants in soil. Also, the sorption capacity of Al-montmorillonite was higher than that of montmorillonite at higher pH. Therefore, Aland All3-montmorillonite can be effective for heavy metal immobilization in neutral or alkaline soil with a high pH buffering capacity. In acidic soil, the solution concentration of heavy metals can hardly be decreased without increasing the pH (Krebs, 1996) Thus, in these soils, Alor Ah3-montmorillonite should be used with limeField experiments have as yet not been conducted to test the effectiveness and durability of immobilization by these substances.

Figure 3.3. Sorption of heavy metals on the manganese oxide bimessite (afier McKenzie, 1980). 

Table 3 -20 shows the results of Mench _et d._ (1994) on water-extractable Cd and Pb contents of untreated and 1% Mn-oxide (on weight basis) treated soil in a pot experiment. Manganese oxide effectively immobilized Cd and Pb. The Cd and Pb contents decreased by about 65. 90%. The Point Zero Charge (PZC) of Mn-oxide lies between 1.5-2.0. The PZC can be defined as the pH at which the surface of soil or soil constituent has a net charge of zero. When the pH is lower than the PZC, the net charge of the surface is positive; when the pH is > PZC, the net charge of the surface is negative. Because of the low PZC, Mn-oxide can sorb heavy metals in acidic soil. Manganese oxide can, however, only be used in aerated soils, because it dissolves under reducing conditions. Field experiments to test the effectiveness and durability of immobilization have not yet been conducted, and are, therefore, necessary.

the soil profile (McBride, 1994). A hardpan may decrease the potential of a soil for plant growth. Therefore, additionzil experiments should be conducted to test if Mn-oxide may form a hardpan in soil, and thus, whether its use involves a risk of decreasing the quality of soil. 

 3.2.4 Gravel sludge 

 Gravel sludge is a waste product of the gravel industry. Its composition depends on its origin. A typical example taken from the Swiss literature (Krebs et d., submitted) contained 41% clay minerals (mainly illites, chlorites and montmorillonites), 30% CaCO3, 18% quartz, 7 % plagioclase, 2% dolomite and 2% organic matter. Table 3.21 shows the average chemical composition of gravel sludge. 

 Gravel sludge may have potential for the immobilization of heavy metals in soil, because of its high CEC of 156 cmoL kg-‘, and its ability to increase the pH (Krebs et d., submitted). The latter can be attributed to its high CaCO3 content. The specific surface area was 8 m2 g‘, which may be considered as low (Krebs et d., submitted). Gravel sludge is available, at least in Switzerland, in large amounts and at low cost. However, it con&s considerable quantities of heavy metals such as Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb (i.e. 15.0 mg Cu, 53.5 mg Zn, 0.13 mg Cd and 10.6 mg Pb kg-’ gravel sludge). This may reduce its acceptance by policy makers, when used for the treatment of polluted soil.

In the presence of gravel sludge the Cu, Zn and Cd contents decreased by about **2040%.** The effect of gravel sludge was not sufficient,

because Cu and Zn still exceed the normal contents in grasses of 4.2 mg Cu and 59 mg Zn kg-’ (on dry weight basis) (Kabata-Pendias &zPendias, 1992).

 In situ immobilizztion Krebs et aZ. (submitted) added 3.7 tons of gravel sludge ha-’ in situ to the upper 20 cm of three sewage sludge amended sandy soils low in organic matter and polluted with Cu and Zn. The pH increased from 6.2-6.9 to 6.8-7.2. The CEC was hardly affected. Table 3.23 shows the (0.1 M) NaNO3-extractable Cu and Zn contents of the (@treated soils. The treatment caused the extractable Cu and Zn contents to decrease to below respectively 1.24 and 2.0 mg kg? The treatment was not effective for Cu in all soils. In one soil, the extractable Cu amount slightly increased from 0.01-0.24 to 0.02-0.26 mg kg? The pH increase with soil organic matter functioning as a source for dissolved/colloidal DOC may have caused this slight increase. A higher dosage of 110 tons of gravel sludge ha-*did not further decrease extractable Zn and Cu contents. According to Krebs et aZ. (submitted), at least part of the immobilization of Cu and Zn was a pH effect. Therefore, other techniques increasing the total sorption capacity of the soil have more potential for the treatment of heavy metal polluted soil.
