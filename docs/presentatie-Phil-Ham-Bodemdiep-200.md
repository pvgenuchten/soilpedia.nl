# Gramling et al. (2002) 

 Gramling et al. consider 1-D, instantaneous colourimetric reactions between solutions of aqueous Na 2 EDTA4-^ and CuSO 4 (both experimental and analytical solution).

# Introduction (1) 

- 2-D Extension of the work by Gramling et al. (2002) 

- Reaction of the form A + B → AB, where rAB = -rA = -rB 

- Contour distribution: 


# Introduction (2) 

 Reactant/Product distributions: 


# Mass balance equations 

 Reactant A and B: 

 Product AB: 

 Adding CB and CAB yields: 


# Mass balance equations 


# Plume Length (1) 

## L = f (αT) not f (αL) 


# Plume Length (2) 

## L = f (αT, αL) 


# Results (1) 

Exact solution AND zeroth order approximation 


# Keijzer et al. (2000) 

 Keijzer et al. consider a 1-D traveling wave solution for transport and biodegradation of a contaminant (electron donor) and electron acceptor controlled (coupled) by Monod reactions. 

 Initial and boundary conditions

 Solution of 

at stationary case is the same as 

 provides similar solution 

 Huang et al. (2003) use imaging to study a steady-state plume resulting from (instantaneous) aerobic degradation. They compare real data to an MT3D solution (instantaneous and Monod kinetic reactions).

# Analysis 

- Diffusion plays an important role on laboratory scale - diffusion     has an influence on the result for the velocities that we have in     the tankl, e.g. Dzz_0.81 = 0.000175 m^2/d + 0.81 m/d * 0.000048 m        = 0.000175 + 0.0000388        = 0.0002138 

- Does transversal dispersivity depend on reactions???
