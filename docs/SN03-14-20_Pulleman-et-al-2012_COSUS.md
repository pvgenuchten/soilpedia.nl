## Introduction 

## The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD; URL: 

## http://www.cbd.int/) and the Millennium Ecosystem 

## Assessment [1] have underlined the relationships between 

## biodiversity loss and a decline in the capacity of ecosystems 

## to support human well-being. Being the legally binding 

## international agreement for the conservation and sustain

## able use of biological diversity, the CBD has stimulated a 

## demand for indicators suited to monitor trends in the state 

## of biodiversity and natural resources [2]. Soils are a natural 

## resource that must be secured for future generations, as 

## rates of soil formation or recovery are often too slow to cope 

## with current rates of soil loss and degradation. Soils also 

## host an enormous biodiversity, in terms of abundance, 

## numbers of species and functions of organisms. The organ

## isms and their interactions are fundamental to many soil 

## processes and functions, including organic matter 

## decomposition, nutrient cycling, soil structure formation, 

## pest regulation and bioremediation of contaminants. In 

## aggregated form these processes and functions relate to 

## ecosystem services that are essential to humans, such as 

## food production, climate regulation and provision of clean 

## water [3,4 

  

## ,5 

  

## ] (Figure 1). Although biodiversity that is 

## ‚Äòhidden‚Äô belowground has long received little attention, 

## this attitude has started to change. Loss of soil biodiversity 

## caused by the expansion, intensification and mechaniza

## tion of agriculture has been identified as a major problem 

## across Europe. Related pressures include soil erosion, 

## organic matter decline, compaction, contamination, salini

## zation and climate change [6,7]. 

## Different EU policies, e.g. on water quality, pesticide use, 

## waste management or nature conservation, contribute in 

## some way to soil protection. However, regulations are 

## very specific to the threat of concern and do not consider 

## soil biodiversity as such, nor the wider context of soil 

## quality. The adoption of the EU Soil Thematic Strategy 

## in 2006 was a first step towards a coordinated approach to 

## ensure the protection of soils in Europe [8]. Further 

## integration of soil biodiversity conservation into EU 

## legislation, however, is hampered because the level of 

## knowledge has been considered insufficient to recom

## mend policy [4 

  

## ]. A better understanding of soil organ

## isms, their distributions, interactions and functions in 

## soils and how they translate into ecosystem services is 

## therefore essential to guide action [7]. A necessary first 

## step is a better knowledge on spatial and temporal distri

### management and habitat quality. A crucial second step is 

### to better communicate the implications for ecosystem 

### services, such that soil biodiversity conservation is taken 

### into account in decision making. In the face of those 

### needs, monitoring of biological soil parameters has been 

### initiated in several countries and data are becoming

### review on soil biodiversity and biological soil indicators, 

### with examples of monitoring programmes across Europe. 

### We aim to address the following objectives: 

### 1. To provide a brief overview of current knowledge and

### sustainable management of soil biodiversity and soil 

### ecosystem services. 

## Soil biodiversity 

### Soil biota comprise the organisms that spend all or part of 

### their life cycle belowground. Soil organisms range from 

### the myriad of invisible microbes, such as bacteria, fungi 

### and protozoa, to the macro-fauna, for example earth

### worms, ants and termites (http://www.fao.org/ag/AGL/ 

### agll/soilbiod/). Larger animals such as moles and voles 

### are considered soil fauna, but rarely included in soil 

### biodiversity assessments because of their small numbers. 

### And although plants belong to the soil biota their role is 

### beyond the scope of this review. It is however recognized 

### that plant root exudates and plant residues form the major 

### source of carbon and energy for heterotrophic soil biota. 

### For an illustrated overview of different soil organisms, 

### their functions and important threats we refer to the

### One of the most complete definitions of soil biodiver

### sity is derived from the CBD definition of biodiversity: 

### Soil biodiversity comprises ‚Äòthe variation in soil life, 

### from genes to communities, and the ecological com

### plexes of which they are part, that is from soil micro

### habitats to landscapes‚Äô [4 

  

### ]. This variation is generally 

### described in terms of three interrelated attributes of 

### biodiversity: composition, structure and function [10]. 

### We then consider soil biodiversity as the quantity, 

### variety and structure of all forms of life in soils, as well 

### as related functions [11]. Soil organisms have tradition

### ally been classified according to their taxonomic pos

### ition, throphic interactions and body size class [12 

  

### ,13]. 

### Taxonomic identification can be problematic because a 

### vast amount of soil organisms has not yet been ident

### ified, especially in the microbial community. Moreover, 

### technical and labor constraints may apply as a result of 

### the huge diversity of certain groups, such as microor

### ganisms, nematodes and mites. Relations between soil 

### biodiversity and ecosystem functions, however, tend to 

### depend more on structural and functional diversity than 

### on species richness or taxonomic parameters per se 

### [14,15,44 

  

### ]. This phenomenon is partly explained by 

### the high level of functional redundancy within species

### rich soil communities [15]. As an exception, so-called 

### ‚Äòkeystone species‚Äô have been identified for their unique 

### role in specialized soil processes [16]. Examples are 

### fungal species that are capable of decomposing recal

### citrant organic compounds [17], symbiotic micro organ

### isms involved in atmospheric N fixation or P uptake by 

### plants [18] or bioturbators like earthworm species (Box 

### 1). 

### Considering the complex of biotic interactions in the soil, 

### in conjunction with the abiotic environment, it is essential 

### to determine soil processes and functions using a com

### prehensive as possible characterization of soil biodiver

### sity. Like ecosystems in general, soils are hierarchical 

### systems with internal processes operating at each level of 

### organization and interacting across levels. Hierarchy 

### theory suggests that higher levels facilitate or constrain 

### the behavior of lower levels. An extensive discussion on 

### the hierarchical relations between habitat characteristics, 

### soil organisms and implications for ecosystem functions is 

### provided by Lavelle [19 

  

### ]. The microbial world 

### represents the major part of the soil community in terms 

### of total biomass and is largely responsible for organic 

### matter decomposition, nutrient transformations and 

### degradation of toxic compounds (Box 3). The soil micro 

### and mesofauna regulate the activities of the microbial 

### community, mainly through predation, thereby releasing 

### nutrients [20]. The soil macrofauna, in turn, can possess a 

### strong effect on the distribution and activities of those 

### smaller groups of soil organisms. For instance, the soil 

### macrofauna comprises ecological groups that have the 

### ability to dig in the soil profile, create burrows, nests 

### and galleries while mixing, ingesting and/or excreting 

### organo-mineral soil material. As they can modify the soil 

### habitat in terms of physical structure and availability of 

### resources to other soil organisms, those soil animals have 

### been characterized as ‚Äòecosystem engineers‚Äô [19 

  

### ] (Box 

### 1). Soil organisms with larger body sizes, including the 

### ecosystem engineers, have frequently been found to be 

### more sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances than smal

### ler organisms [21‚Äì23]. Hierarchical theory suggests that 

### the disappearance of soil ecosystem engineers can have 

### strong impacts at lower levels of organization, including 

### biological regulation by smaller soil fauna. 

##### Soil biodiversity, biological indicators and soil ecosystem services Pulleman et al. 531 

 Box 1 Examples from different broad functional groups that have frequently been used as biological soil indicators: Earthworms (photograph: R.G. de Goede. 

 Earthworms: These invertebrates belong to the functional group of ecosystem engineers [3,4  ]. By producing soil structures such as burrows and excrements they strongly modify the habitat for other soil organisms, including plant roots. Earthworms can play a particularly large role in litter transformation and incorporation as well as soil structure formation [22]. Earthworms are used as bioindicators in contaminated soils because of their sensitivity to soil pollutants (e.g. heavy metals and organic contaminants) [28]. They also respond strongly to agricultural practices (e.g. tillage, crop rotations, pesticides application, organic matter inputs) [22,28,32,37,44,53]. Species (e.g. approximately 100 in France) are classified into three ecological groups (anecics, endogeics and epigeics) that provide different functions and show different sensitivity to soil disturbances or chemical contamination [28,53,32,54]. Epigeic earthworms live at the soil surface and feed on plant litter. Anecics create permanent vertical or subvertical burrows and feed at the soil surface. Those two groups are negatively affected by soil tillage. Endogeics feed on mineral soil enriched in soil organic matter, and therefore benefit from organic matter incorporation either through tillage or the activities of epigeics or anecic earthworms [55]. Anecic and endogeic earthworms play a key role in the formation and maintenance of soil structure, enhance water infiltration and remediation of soil pollutants and reduce soil erosion [30,37]. Total abundance or biomass of earthworms are commonly used as indicators (Table 2). Nevertheless the functional group diversity may be a better proxy for habitat quality and soil functions [11,28,53]. An important advantage of earthworms as indicators is that taxonomic identification is relatively easy. Earthworms can be observed with the naked eye and are commonly known, and are therefore suitable for communication purposes with stakeholders. However, their spatial variability in the field can be high, which makes representative sampling a laborious task.

### Accordingly, Kibblewhite et al. [3] and Turbe ÃÅ^ et al. [4 

  

### ] 

### classified soil organisms into functional assemblages that 

### act at different spatio-temporal scales, and are associated 

### with different functional domains [19 

  

### ] (Figure 1). A 

### distinction is made between: 

### 1. ‚ÄòDecomposers‚Äô and ‚Äònutrient transformers‚Äô [3] 

### (grouped as ‚Äòchemical engineers‚Äô by Turbe ÃÅ et al. 

### [4 

  

### ]), that is soil microorganisms (Box 3); 

### 2. ‚ÄòBiocontrollers‚Äô [3] (or ‚Äòbiological regulators‚Äô [4 

  

### ]), that 

### is small invertebrates, such as nematodes (Box 2), 

### springtails and mites, which act as herbivores or 

### predate on other invertebrates or micro-organisms; 

### 3. ‚ÄòEcosystem engineers‚Äô, that is soil macrofauna such as 

### termites, earthworms (Box 1), or ants. 

### It should be noted that this broad classification does 

### provide a generalization as multiple functions can be 

### performed by different functional assemblages and over

### lap in functions occurs across all levels (e.g. microbes can 

### contribute to soil aggregate formation [24]). Furthermore, 

### the functional assemblages do not operate in isolation. 

### This implies that an intervention that affects one function 

### will inevitably alter other functions [3,19 

  

### ] (Figure 1). 

## Biological soil indicators 

### The concept of indicators is widely used in environmental 

### monitoring, mainly in relation to anthropogenic disturb

### ances. Indicators are measurable surrogates for environ

### mental end points that are in themselves too complex to 

### assess. Such indicators, either biological, physical or chemi

### cal, give information about the state and trends as well as 

### the seriousness of the situation, and should support 

### environmental decision making [2,4 

  

### ,10]. The soil com

### munity provides many potentially interesting indicators for 

### environmental monitoring in response to a range of stresses 

### or disturbances [3,25‚Äì27,28 

  

### ]. According to Gerhardt [29], 

### we define biological indicators as (characteristics of) organ

### isms whose response, in terms of presence/absence, abun

### dance, activity, morphology, physiology or behavior, gives 

### information on the condition of a habitat or ecosystem. 

### They are useful in situations where the environmental end 

### point is difficult to measure directly, or where the environ

### mental stressor is easy to measure but difficult to interpret 

### in terms of ecological significance [29]. Biological soil 

### indicators have been applied in environmental risk assess

### ment and monitoring of responses to land use (e.g. [30,31]), 

### agricultural management (e.g. [28 

  

### ,30,31,32,33 

  

### ]) and soil 

### contamination (e.g. [26,28 

  

### ]). The parameters measured 

### include different soil organisms selected for their sensi

### tivity to soil management or environmental pressures, and/ 

### or for their relevance for soil functions (such as organic 

### matter decomposition, N mineralization or soil structure 

### formation) or for soil quality or soil health in general [3,25]. 

### The hierarchical organization of the soil community and 

### ecosystems suggest that soil biodiversity be monitored at 

### multiple levels of organization (organism, population, 

### community, ecosystem) and at multiple spatial scales 

### (e.g. from plot to farm to landscape) [10,19]. Different 

### organisms from the three functional groups or hierarchical 

### levels described in the previous section have frequently 

### been used as biological soil indicators (see Boxes 1 ‚Äì 3 for 

### examples). Other organism groups that have commonly 

### been measured in monitoring programmes are micro

### arthropods, for example collembola (springtails) and acari 

### (mites) [31,34] and other mesofauna, for example enchy

### traeids (potworms) [31] (Table 2). In addition to the 

### organisms themselves, soil structures created by soil

 Box 2 Examples from different broad functional groups that have frequently been used as biological soil indicators: Nematodes. The picture represents a nematode curling through the soil pore space (photograph: K. Ritz). 

 Nematodes are biological regulators and represent one of the most numerous and speciose groups in soils. Soil nematodes are trophically diverse and include economically important plant parasites. They show a high and diverse sensitivity to pollutants and because of their trophic diversity nematode assemblages do not only reflect their own fate, but also the condition of the bacterial, fungal and protozoan communities. These characteristics make them potentially interesting bio-indicators for soil health and soil disturbances [56]. Although nematodes can easily be sampled and extracted from soil, their identification is time consuming and requires expert knowledge. Previous studies demonstrate that the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) gene harbors enough phylogenetic signal to distinguish between nematode families, genera and often species [57]. A robust and affordable quantitative PCR-based nematode detection tool for agricultural and scientific purposes, and comparable tools for the assessment of the ecological condition of soils, are being developed [58]. Briefly this works as follows: after nematodes extraction from soil the nematode community is lysed and after DNA purification the lysate is used to quantitatively characterize nematode assemblages. The difference in DNA contents of various life stages is limited and different distributions of the life stages barely interfere with quantitative community analyses. Verification in recent field studies suggests that Q-PCR based analysis of nematode assemblages is a reliable alternative for microscopic analysis. The availability of an affordable and user-friendly tool might facilitate and stimulate the use of this ecological informative group of soil inhabitants.

### system engineers, have been identified, quantified and 

### proposed as indicators [22,35]. 

### Criteria for the selection of indicators that are suitable for 

### monitoring purposes have been summarized by Ritz et al. 

### [36] and Turbe ÃÅ et al. [4 

  

### ] (Table 1). No single indicator 

### will comply with all these criteria. In practice, focus is on 

### the development of sets of complementary indicators, 

### including both biotic and abiotic parameters. However, 

### despite the fact that a multitude of indicators estimating 

### some aspect of soil biodiversity exists, no reference set of 

### standardized indicators is available. This issue, as well as 

### promising avenues for progress on indicator development 

### and application, are discussed in the remainder of this 

### paper. 

## Examples of European approaches 

### Since the late 1980s biological parameters have been 

### assessed in an increasing number of studies, ranging from 

### long-term agricultural field trials [20,21,32,37] to regional 

### or national monitoring programmes (e.g. [30,31,36,38]). 

### Currently there are over 15 European countries that have 

### collected soil biological parameters as part of a large scale 

### monitoring programme [4 

  

### ]. Some examples are provided 

### in Table 2. Ideally this would provide the foundation for 

### integrated assessments of soil biodiversity across a wide 

### range of situations in Europe. However, the information 

### has been collected for different objectives and using a 

### variety of methods, and few indicators have consistently 

### been used in national-scale monitoring [31,36]. Recent 

### attempts to develop standardized indicator sets that 

### comply with the criteria listed in Table 1 are briefly 

### reviewed here. 

### Frameworks for selecting biological indicators for national 

### soil monitoring have been devised in, for example, France 

### [28 

  

### ], the Netherlands [31] and the UK [36]. These 

### frameworks adopted a similar approach; a wide range 

### of candidate indicators were assembled and tested for

 Box 3 Examples from different broad functional groups that have frequently been used as biological soil indicators: Microorganisms. The picture on the left side represents bacterial cells. The picture on the right shows fungal hyphae in soil (blue stained) as observed in a soil thin section (photograph: K. Ritz). 

 Microorganisms: Chemical engineers decompose organic matter and transform nutrients. Soil microorganisms dominate this functional group [3,4]. They indicate environmental changes by modifications in (i) quantity/biomass, (ii) structure and/or (iii) activity [36,38]. Until now the impact of microbial biomass versus community structure on ecosystem processes and function is uncertain [38,59,60,62]. Levels of functional redundancy among microorganisms depend largely on function and environment considered [15,16,61]. Disconnections between factors driving microbial community structure and those driving its function further complicate indicator selection [62]. To comprehensively assess soil microbial diversity it is recommended to include indicators of each parameter group: quantity, structure and activity [11]. However, the number of studies and monitoring networks using indicators of all three groups is limited (Table 2). Different methods [41] are used to describe and quantify microbial diversity at the genotype, phenotype or metabolic level, and thousands of microbial species can occur in just a few grams of soil. To achieve progress in the area of microbial indicators it is important to work on the definition and identification of microbial functional groups and their response to environmental changes [61]. Beside molecular approaches new conceptual models and experimentation are needed to link microbial diversity to ecosystem functions. The development of concepts describing the relationship between the stoichiometry of soil microorganisms (e.g. the C, N and P status) and nutrient cycling is promising [39]. 

 Table 1 

 Seven criteria for the selection of biological soil indicators 

1. Meaningful ‚Äì Indicators must relate to important ecological     functions 

2. Standardized ‚Äì Parameters should be standardized to ensure     comparability of data 

3. Measurable and cost efficient ‚Äì Parameters should be     assessable not only by experts, in order to ensure that     the indicators will be used in practice and can be routinely     collected 

4. Policy relevance ‚Äì Indicators should be sensitive to changes     at policy-relevant spatio-temporal scales, and allow for     comparisons with a baseline situation to capture progress     towards policy targets 

5. Spatio-temporal coverage ‚Äì Indicators should be validated     in a wide range of conditions and should be amenable to     aggregation or disaggregation at different spatial scales, from     ecosystem to national and international levels 

6. Understandability ‚Äì Indicators should be simple and easily     understood 

7. Accuracy ‚Äì The value of the indicators should be precise     and robust reflecting the changes they monitor

### of the indicators, their ability to discriminate between 

### soil-land use combinations and their ecological interpret

### ation [36]. 

### One example of such work is the ongoing (2006‚Äì2012) 

### French national BioIndicator programme [28 

  

### ]. Using 

### homogeneous procedures, 47 biological parameters were 

### assessed in a large number of sites differing in land use, 

### agricultural management, contamination type and pollu

### tion levels. Those included microorganisms, fauna and 

### flora at the community level (e.g. abundance, biomass, 

### species and functional composition and ecological traits) 

### as well as the organism level (e.g. gene expression) (Table 

### 2). Their potential to be used as a bioindicator for national 

### scale monitoring was validated based on their sensitivity 

### to different environmental conditions and disturbances, 

### and their accessibility and applicability by experts and 

### non-specialist stakeholders. 

### In parallel with national initiatives, European research 

### projects have been initiated to promote standardization of 

### biological soil indicators, mainly through Framework 

### Programmes (FP) [4 

  

### ]. Among those, the FP6 project 

### ENVASSO (Environmental Assessment of Soil Monitor

### ing) was the first attempt to develop a harmonized system 

### for soil biodiversity monitoring across Europe. Standar

### dized indicator sets were defined and organized into 

### different priority levels [11]. ‚ÄòLevel I‚Äô indicators included 

### organisms, corresponding with the functional classifi

### cation of Kibblewhite et al. [3], as well as ecological 

### functions: 

### (1) abundance, biomass and species diversity of earth

### worms (or enchytraeids if no earthworms are present, 

### for example in soils with low pH); 

### (2) abundance and species diversity of collembola; 

### (3) microbial respiration 

### Depending on local objectives and available resources, 

### the key indicators could be complemented with ‚Äòlevel II‚Äô 

### or ‚Äòlevel III‚Äô indicators [11]. Procedures and protocols, 

### based on ISO standards [39‚Äì41], have been tested in pilot 

### sites in France, Ireland, Portugal and Hungary to assess 

### the efficiency and sensitivity of the indicators across 

### European land-use categories [11]. 

### The abovementioned projects showed that different bio

### logical parameters were (more) discriminative to different 

### types of disturbances, for example soil cultivation versus 

### heavily contaminated soils [28 

  

### ]. Comparison of data 

### between consecutive samplings over multiple years indi

### cated that species composition tends to be relatively 

### stable, but abundances and biomasses were more vari

### able, depending for example on weather conditions and 

### crop rotations [11,28 

  

### ,31]. In order to interpret the 

### results, there is a strong need to define reference values 

### for certain combinations of land use, soil type and climatic 

### conditions. Such references do not yet exist at a European 

### scale, although density ranges for different groups of 

### organisms have been published for a selection of soil 

### and land use types in the Netherlands [31] and France 

### [42]. Among the objectives of the ongoing FP7 project 

### Ecofinders are the standardization of methodologies for 

### the assessment of biological soil indicators, and charac

### terization of normal operating ranges for soil biodiversity 

### according to climatic zones, soil and land uses types [43]. 

### The increasing availability of ISO standards [39‚Äì41] for 

### sampling procedures and analyses is an important step 

### towards homogenization of procedures, but further work 

### is still required [11]. 

### Another important challenge for biological soil indicators 

### is to capture the spatio-temporal scales over which 

### environmental changes occur. Depending on life history 

### traits and dispersal characteristics, certain groups of soil 

### organisms can respond slowly to land use or management 

### changes [32,44 

  

### ]. Those observations emphasize the 

### need for sampling designs with wide spatiotemporal 

### coverage [3,11,32]. Long-term field experiments remain 

### important to enhance our understanding of biotic 

### responses with time after changes in management or land 

### use occur, as well as the underlying mechanisms 

### [32,37,44 

  

### ]. 

## Linking biological soil indicators and 

## ecosystem services for decision support 

### The rationale behind soil monitoring and the use of 

### biological indicators is to assess trends in the state of soil 

### resources as a habitat for soil organisms, as well as their 

### capacity to support human well-being. Monitoring should 

### further provide information to decision makers on what 

### needs to be done to halt or revert negative trends. The 

### decision support function of the indicators therefore 

### implies that they facilitate communication with a variety 

### of end users such as policy makers and land managers. 

### Interpretation of the data in terms of ecosystem services, 

### defined as the beneficial flows arising from natural capital 

### stocks and fulfilling human needs [5 

  

### ], is a first step. It has 

### been shown that pragmatic choices enable quantification 

### of soil quality through the performance of multiple 

### ecosystem services, based on data derived from monitor

### ing of biotic and abiotic soil properties [31,33 

  

### ,45,46]. 

### Velasquez et al. [46] and Ruiz et al. [45] showed how

### synthetic indicators of soil quality can be developed 

### through the evaluation of different soil ecosystem ser

### vices. These compound indicators are derived from 

### physical, chemical and biological soil parameters using 

### multivariate analyses. These approaches allow for 

### monitoring of change through time and variation between 

### sites or farms, without relying on expert opinion. Values 

### need to be calibrated and validated with respect to the 

### regional or national context of the study, but the meth

### odology used to derive these indices can be applied 

### everywhere [45,46]. Through a system of reference values 

### for certain soil and land use types performances can be 

### compared on a relative scale [31,33 

  

### ]. 

### Stakeholder involvement and weighting of trade-offs 

### between multiple ecosystem services is central to the 

### identification and prioritization of ecosystem services by 

### different end users [33 

  

### ,47]. The abovementioned 

### approaches [31,33 

  

### ,45,46] are examples of communi

### cation tools that can be applied in awareness raising 

### and multi-stakeholder processes and have already be 

### implemented in practical situations [28 

  

### ,33 

  

### ]. When 

### spatially presented, derived models can demonstrate that 

### different options in land-use planning and management 

### result in highly different impacts on soil biodiversity, 

### including differences in functional attributes [12 

  

### ,48]. 

### For proper quantification of ecosystem services indicators 

### should be fitted to so called ‚Äòutility‚Äô functions which 

### transform the specific units of the indicator to a uniform 

### scale for ecosystem service performance [49]. This is not 

### straightforward because ecosystem services act on differ

### ent spatial and temporal scales. For a detailed overview of 

### current thinking on, and approaches for, the classification 

### and quantification of soil ecosystem services we refer to 

### Dominati et al. [5 

  

### ]. 

### Finally, until now, interpretation of biological soil 

### indicators in terms of ecosystem services has largely been 

### based on expert judgements [33 

  

### ,36]. A more robust and 

### quantitative approach relies on empirical testing and 

### development of models. Datasets derived from soil bio

### diversity monitoring provide potentially important 

### sources of information. One promising avenue for linking 

### anthropogenic disturbances, soil biodiversity and ecosys

### tem services is based on ecological traits, that is the 

### morphological, physiological, behavioral or life-history 

### attributes of organisms. Identifying traits that determine 

### the response of soil organisms to (changing) environmen

### tal conditions, and/or can be linked to effects on ecosys

### tem functions has several advantages. Those include a 

### better mechanistic understanding of the relationships and 

### possible generalizations across eco-regions, independent 

### of taxonomy [28 

  

### ,50,51]. Information on trait values 

### of soil organisms being accumulated in databases can 

### be connected with the occurrence of a species as an 

### indicator [28 

  

### ]. For example, the body size of organisms 

### strongly determines their spatial aggregation patterns and 

### dispersal distances, as well as their lifetimes and sensi

### tivity to habitat disturbances with consequences for 

### multiple, interconnected soil functions [21,23]. Mulder 

### et al. [12 

  

### ] showed how mining of databases of abiotic and 

### biotic soil variables can be used to explore general 

### relationships between habitat characteristics, the (trait) 

### structure of the soil community and ecosystem function

### ing. Ecological concepts such as allometry, that is 

### size-abundance relationships amongst organisms in the 

### soil community, and stoichiometry, that is the biotic 

### relationships of plants and soil organisms in terms of 

### chemical compositions (e.g. nutrient-to-carbon ratios) 

### were explored. Such ecological concepts provide oppor

### tunities to develop mechanistic models of invertebrate 

### responses to environmental changes. Detritus-based food 

### web modeling has already been used successfully for 

### quantification of nutrient and carbon flows based on soil 

### biodiversity assessments [20,52]. A next step is to develop 

### these models for predicting multiple functions and ser

### vices [3,50], provided that hierarchical organization of the 

### soil community into functional assemblages and inter

### connectedness of soil ecosystem functions are taken into 

### account. 

## Conclusions 

### To support policy and decision making towards the 

### sustainable management of soils across Europe, there is 

### a need for the monitoring and communication of bio

### logical soil indicators that are linked to soil functions and 

### ecosystem services. No single indicator is universally 

### applicable and different indicators, including biotic as 

### well as abiotic parameters, are needed for different func

### tions and environmental conditions. Functional assem

### blages of soil organisms have been distinguished and their 

### hierarchical organization should be reflected in soil bio

### diversity assessments and biological soil indicator sets. 

### The development of sets of complementary indicators 

### requires validation across a wide range of environmental 

### conditions using standardized methods to produce accu

### rate and consistent results. Despite considerable progress 

### and several initiatives contributing to indicator selection 

### and homogenization of methods, major scientific and 

### practical issues remain to be addressed. Those include 

### (i) adequate funding to allow sufficient spatiotemporal 

### coverage in soil monitoring systems; (ii) definition of 

### reference values for different combinations of land use, 

### soil type and climate; (iii) obtaining a better predictive 

### understanding of the relationships between anthropo

### genic disturbances, soil biodiversity and ecosystem ser

### vices. Detailed assessments in long-term trials or 

### observatories (LTO‚Äôs) across Europe remain important. 

### Additionally, integration of datasets across national bor

### ders offers data mining opportunities to develop ecologi

### cal concepts and modeling of ecosystem services. 

### Promising avenues include approaches based on the 

### analysis of ecological traits, and studying the extent to 

### which driving forces behind the partitioning of energy in

### Finally, the knowledge thus generated should be applied 

### in decision making, which requires simple and clear
