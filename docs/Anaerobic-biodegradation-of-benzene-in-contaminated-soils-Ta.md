# Anaerobic biodegradation ofbenzene in contaminated soilsNico TanWim van DoesburgFons Stams 


# Research aim ^ Isolate anaerobic organisms degraded benzene (nitrate andsulfate) ^ study their physiological and phylogenetic properties to getinsight into their occurrence and distribution in polluted soils ^ Two enrichments (chlorate and nitrate) that degrade benzene ^ Determining their composition (genetically) ^ Looking at their physiological properties (intermediates) 


# Research plans ^ Isolate anaerobic organisms degraded benzene ^ Characterize the enrichment cultures ^ Test intermediates ^ Isotopic fractionation experiment
