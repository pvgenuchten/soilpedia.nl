## General Information 

##  This report covers R&D work carried out by Dr. Gadi Rothenberg and Marjo Mittelmeijer 

## from The University of Amsterdam, as part of the SKB demonstration project “Toepassing 

## van de Sorbisampler bij grondwatermonitoring in het kader van grondwatersanering”; 

## SKB project # PT5408. 

##  This report includes a description of the experimental work performed, a complete 

## experimental and methods section, a summary of the results, and recommendations for 

## adsorbent implementation in Sorbisamplers for the above SKB project. 

##  This report also includes the standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be used by labs 

## participating in the project (Alcontrol) for extraction and analysis of the relevant 

## adsorbents. 

## Experimental Section 

## Materials and instrumentation. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was performed using a 

# CE instruments GC8000 Top gas chromatograph, with a -DEX 120 column (30 m  0.25 mm  

## 0.25 μm film thickness), and He as carrier gas (2ml/min flow). All chemicals were purchased from 

## commercial sources (>99% pure unless indicated otherwise). Adsorbents were pre-treated as given 

## below. 

## GC Temperature program for ocresol: Isotherm at 72 °C for 3 min, ramp at 60 °C/min to 180 

## °C, isotherm at 180 °C for 2 min. n -Nonane (C 9 H 20 ) was used as internal standard. 

## GC Temperature program for vinyl chloride and dichloroethylene: Isotherm at 60 °C for 3 

## min, ramp at 60 °C/min to 120 °C, isotherm at 120 °C for 1 min. n -Nonane (C 9 H 20 ) was used as 

## internal standard.

## Adsorbent pre-treatment. Each adsorbent was first wetted to incipient wetness, and then 

## dried on filter paper until the particles did not stick together. The transition to incipient wetness is 

## sharp and easily observable (the particles stick together like ‘wet sand’). This procedure ensures 

## that all of the pores are filled with water, but that no extra water is present, and it is essential if one

## adsorbent can be as high as 100 wt%. 

## Procedure for extracting ocresol from aqueous solution. Saturated stock solution of o

## cresol was prepared by shaking excess amounts of the compound in water (solubility of o-cresol in 

## water at 25 °C 25.95 mg/ml). 1 ml of the aqueous solution was taken and shaken with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 

## and 10 ml of either CH 2 Cl 2 , or toluene. The phases were separated and n-nonane (internal 

## standard) was added to 1.00 mL of the solvent layer, and the sample was analyzed by GC. 

## Procedure for extracting vinyl chloride and dichloroethylene from aqueous solution. 

## Saturated stock solution of dichloroethylene was prepared by shaking excess amounts of the 

## compound in water (solubility of dichloroethylene in water at 25 °C 3.5 mg/ml) Saturated stock 

## solution of vinylchoride was prepared by bubbling vinylchloride through water of 4 °C for 1 hour. 

## At 25 °C large bubbles were sticking to the wall of the flask (solubility of vinylchloride in water at 

## 25 °C 1.1 mg/ml). 2 ml of the aqueous solution was taken and shaken with 2, 3 and 4 ml CH 2 Cl 2. 

## The phases were separated and n-nonane (internal standard) was added to 1.00 mL of the solvent 

## layer, and the sample was analyzed by GC. 

## Procedure for measuring solid-phase sequestering of ocresol from water. To test the 

## sorption of ocresol, vials containing 0.100 g, 0.200 g, 0.300 g, 0.400 g or 0.500 g adsorbent and 

## 1.00 mL of one of the aqueous stock solutions were shaken (orbital shaker) for 1 h at 25 °C. Then, 

## 0.50 mL aliquots were taken and shaken vigorously with 2.00 mL CH 2 Cl 2. The phases were 

## separated and nnonane (internal standard) was added to 1.00 mL of the CH 2 Cl 2 layer, and the 

## sample was analyzed by GC.

## from water. To test the sorption of vinyl chloride and dichloroethylene, vials containing 0.100 g 

## adsorbent and 3.00 mL, 6.00 mL and 9.00 mL of one of the aqueous stock solutions were shaken 

## (orbital shaker) for 1 h at 25 °C. Then, 1.0 mL aliquots were taken and shaken vigorously with 

## 2.00 mL CH 2 Cl 2. The phases were separated and nnonane (internal standard) was added to 1.00 

## mL of the CH 2 Cl 2 layer, and the sample was analyzed by GC.

## CH 2 Cl 2 , or toluene was added and the vials were shaken vigorously. 

## In the case of vinyl chloride and dichloroethylene, 5.00 mL of the aqueous solution were added to 

## 0.050 gram of Ambersorb 572, and shaken for 1 h. 5.00 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 was added and shaken 

## vigorously. The GC results were compared to vials that did not contain any adsorbent.

## Standard operating laboratory procedures (SOPs, for Alcontrol) 

## The following procedures are scaled to 1.0 gram of wetted adsorbent in the Sorbisampler, and are 

## based on the procedures described above. In practice, this amount of adsorbent will vary from 3 

## (cresols) to 6 gram (vinyl chloride and dichloroethylene), and the amounts in the SOP could be 

## scaled accordingly. This scaling should not present any problem with regard to the analysis 

## procedure.

## Summary of Results 

## Abbreviations: OC  ocresol; VC  vinyl chloride; DCE  dichloroethylene. 

## Of the four adsorbents tested, the superior absorbent was in all cases Ambersorb 572. Adsorption 

## capacity was 0.265 gram ocresol, 0.350 gram dichlorethylene and 0.120 gram vinylchloride per 

## gram Ambersorb 572. Dichloromethane was the best performing extraction solvent. 

## Results for extracting cresol from the aqueous solution to an organic layer. 3 mL of 

## CH 2 Cl 2 removed 91% of the OC from 1 mL of a saturated aqueous solution. 4 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 were 

## sufficient to remove all the OC. Toluene was nor only a less capable extractor, but also interfered 

## more in the chromatogram. 

## Results for extracting dichloroethylene and vinylchloride from the aqueous solution to an 

## organic layer. With 1 ml of CH 2 Cl 2 all the dichloroethylene and all the VC could be remove from 

## 1 mL of the aqueous solution. 

## Results for testing the re-extractability the adsorbed analytes. The results showed that 4 

## mL CH 2 Cl 2 was capable to re-extract the adsorbed OC for >99% from 0.1 gram of the fully loaded 

## adsorbent, even in the presence of a 1 ml water layer. Again toluene showed a less good capability 

## to re-extract OC from the Ambersorb 572 and also again interfered in the chromatogram. For the 

## VC and the DCE, 5 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 was sufficient for extracting >99% of the adsorbed phases from 

## 0.05 gram of the adsorbent, in the presence of a 5 ml water layer.
