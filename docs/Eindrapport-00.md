# Eindrapportage-formulier TRIAS projecten 

# Final report format for TRIAS projects. 

When a TRIAS project has finished, or is about to finish, a Final Report is required. This report serves several goals simultaneously: 

- it enables NWO-ALW to finalize the project administratively, e.g. pay the final     part of the personnel costs of the project, 

- it enables the program commission to check whether the project has met its     goals, 

- it provides some of the information needed for evaluation purposes, 

- it provides information which can be publicized, e.g. via a web site. 

We have integrated the questionnaires from TRIAS and ALW into one, in order to prevent the need to fill in the same answers twice. 

Please send in the filled out forms within a month after the project is completed to: Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research Earth and Life Sciences Carmen van Meerkerk and/or Theo Saat P.O. Box 93510 2509 AM The Hague

 05 Short scientific summary (500 words) of: main research objective, research methods, results and conclusion 

The quality of groundwater is threatened by the presence of chemicals in, for example, leachates from landfills. Groundwater ecosystems are, however, able to recover from chemical pollution by removing the chemicals by microbial degradation. This self-purifying process is often referred to as natural attenuation and may be monitored and stimulated in order to remediate contaminated sites. The overall objective of this project, executed at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam and Wageningen University, was to identify the environmental, biological and chemical prerequisites for biodegradation by groundwater microorganisms (in concert with the existing fauna). The aim was to develop, together with the results of in situ degradation potential measurements, an integrated geochemical, ecological and environmental chemical toolbox for the evaluation of the natural attenuation capacity of polluted subsurface environments. Elements of this toolbox, developed in this programme, are listed below: Opmerking: de navolgende issues sluiten naar formulering niet goed aan bij deze inleidende zin, met name issues 4 en 5 zijn meer beschouwend dan stellend; met het oog op de leesbaarheid graag aanpassen! 

1. Evidence for in situ anaerobic BTEX degradation in different polluted aquifers, based     on measurements in microcosms and on groundwater samples (metabolites, isotope     fractionation of BTEX compounds) 

2. Identification of ...Specific populations (e.g Geobacter spp., Dehalococcoides spp.)     indicative for the occurrence of biodegradation; these species or the genes involved     in pollutant degradation can be monitored at other locations (see point 3). 

3. A molecular method to quantify the abundance, as well as the metabolic potential     and activity of populations involved in biodegradation of chlorinated hydrocarbons     using functional markers relating to halorespiration. This allows us to study     bioremediation processes in-situ and thus gain knowledge on what are the essential     factors of influence 

4. Mathematical models, combined with Ecological Control Analysis, can be applied to     suggest? alternative strategies in soil protection and bioremediation: for example     the (theoretical) potential of bacteria-eating protozoa to enhance the bacteria-     mediated degradation of pollutants, via nutrient-recycling. 

 Vraag: zijn er ‘matehematical models’ ontwikkeld in dit project en hoe past deze issue bij de inleidende zin (‘Elements of this toolbox developed ... are:’? 

5. Evidence of a large heterogeneity in community structure and microbial abundance ..... Hydrogeochemistry and subsurface sediment-attached microbial community structure (both in general as for (the number of members belonging to) specific groups of microorganisms) can vary dramatically over short distances (meter-scale) as well over time and reveals a large heterogeneity in community structure and microbial abundance. This characteristic has consequences for the sampling design (i.e. a requirement for the number of samples and locations), but on the other hand a high environmental heterogeneity may enhance natural 


attenuation because of a large diversity in micro-organisms capable of pollutant degradation, scattered over the area. 

N.b.: dat heterogeniteit moet leiden tot een groot aantal monsters is m.i. niet automatisch waar; het volgt in elk geval niet uit de geostatistische theorie. Zowel aantal als plaatsing zijn van belang, zodat je een goed inzicht krijgt in de variatie zelf en het verband met de afstand, de diepte en (in dit geval) met de aard van het sediment en redoxomstandigheden. 

These results were obtained using an interdisciplinary experimental approach combining ecology, microbiology, environmental chemistry and statistics. Central in the applied methodology were molecular techniques addressing either rRNA genes or functional genes relating to degradation of pollutants, aiming at both presence (DNA-based) and activity (mRNA-based). The molecular techniques were combined with conventional enrichments or culturing and new techniques such as isotopic labelling of fatty acids, isotope fractionation and metabolite determination. We established the trophic structure in groundwater communities and the relationships between (micro)eukaryotes, prokaryotes and hydrochemistry. With respect to prokaryotes, the focus was especially on anaerobic bacterial degradation of chlorinated and monoaromatic hydrocarbons, important groundwater pollutants in the Netherlands. 

Three research locations were examined in detail. These were i) the downstream area of the Banisveld landfill (mixed contamination, mainly BTEX), ii) the Brabant-site (chlorinated ethenes), and iii) the Limburg site (BTEX, chlorinated ethenes). 

At the Banisveld location, trophic structure was simple: larger groundwater fauna was absent. Micro-eukaryote communities had a relatively low diversity compared to other environmental settings and this diversity decreased with depth. Bacterivorous protozoa were detected in a few samples. Community profiles of bacteria and eukaryotic communities associated with sediment samples revealed large differences over short distances (meterscale). This heterogeneity in composition adds to overall diversity at the research location and may be of benefit for natural attenuation, as leachate has a higher chance to encounter a bacterium able to degrade pollutants contained in it. In addition to a large spatial heterogeneity in sediment samples, also a large temporal heterogeneity in the groundwater community structure was observed over a period of 6 years. 

The Banisveld location also received major attention with respect to the (potential for) in situ anaerobic degradation of monoaromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX). The biodegradation by groundwater microorganisms from core samples taken from contaminated and uncontaminated sites was assessed in order to compare the effect of previous exposure on the response of microbial communities. For the first time we were able to prove the potential for anaerobic p-xylene degradation under iron-reducing conditions. GC-MS analyses and carbon-13 labeled contaminants were used to identify the metabolites produced during their biodegradation and to investigate the incorporation of carbon from the contaminants into biomass. These results were related to microbial community structure analysis obtained through molecular profiling of BTEX degrading cultures. They suggested a role for Geobacters in degradation. Selected groundwater samples were analysed by GC-IRMS to determine whether isotopic fractionation of the BTEX substrates, indicative of biodegradation, takes place in situ. This was the case. 


Molecular tools were developed that allow to measure degradation potential and activity of halorespiring microbes. Such knowledge is important to identify subsoil conditions that optimally promote and sustain microbial degradation. Halorespiration by anaerobic bacteria is a naturally occurring process that can be used in the remediation of sites polluted with chlorinated compounds like PCE (tetrachloroethylene). Our interest was focussed on the metabolic function of the microorganisms rather than their identity and thus dehalogenaseencoding genes were chosen as functional markers for their detection. Primers were validated for the amplification of dehalogenase genes from halorespiring isolates and environmental samples. Abundance and metabolic activity of dehalogenating organisms was quantified by specific 16S ribosomal RNA and dehalogenase gene targeted real-time PCR assays, using environmental DNA as well as RNA as templates. Results from the PCR approach were linked to results obtained by community fingerprinting (DGGE) and physicochemical characteristics of remediated sites under investigation. 

The tools and approaches used and developed in this project will make it possible to predict and monitor natural attenuation processes occurring at other sites better and will contribute to the management and remediation of other contaminated groundwater systems. 

 06 Popular summary to inform the general public (1/2 to 2 pages of text) The funding organisations of TRIAS (SKB, NWO-ALW and Delft Cluster) want to inform a more general audience about the results of the TRIAS Research projects. That is why we ask you to give an executive summary of the project in a popularising way. 

Een onderzoeksproject, uitgevoerd aan de Vrije Universiteit, Universiteit van Amsterdam, en Wageningen Universiteit, heeft geleid tot een sterk verbeterd inzicht in biologische processen die van belang zijn bij de afbraak van belangrijke grondwaterverontreinigingen, zoals oliecomponenten en gechloreerde afvalproducten van wasserijen. De resultaten zijn van belang voor bodembescherming en de beoordeling van de natuurlijke afbraak van vervuiling. 

Grondwater is een belangrijke bron van drinkwater in Nederland. Daarnaast worden rivieren en natuurgebieden gevoed door opwellend grondwater. Veel grondwater is vervuild, vooral met relatief goed-oplosbare organische stoffen zoals oliecomponenten en gechloreerde koolwaterstoffen. Dit beperkt het gebruik van grondwater en levert mogelijk gevaar op voor mens en natuur. In totaal zijn er naar schatting in Nederland zo’n 600,000 vervuilde locaties. Het actief opruimen of vastleggen van die vervuiling zou de Nederlandse maatschappij vele miljarden kunnen kosten. Echter, in het verleden is gebleken dat de ondergrond, daar waar het grondwater zich bevindt, vaak een natuurlijk vermogen bezit om met name organische verontreinigingen af te breken of vast te leggen. Als dit proces maar voldoende snel verloopt, zou het bij veel verontreinigde locaties niet nodig zijn om in te grijpen: men zou kunnen vertrouwen op de natuurlijke processen, tegen aanzienlijk lagere kosten. Om daadwerkelijk te vertrouwen op natuurlijke afbraak is het belangrijk om inzicht te hebben in welke processen nu belangrijk zijn in die natuurlijke afbraak en hoe men die belangrijke processen zou kunnen meten. 


Het doel van deze studie was het in kaart brengen van natuurlijke afbraakprocessen met nadruk op de afbraak onder zuurstofloze omstandigheden van monoaromatische oliecomponenten (dit zijn oliecomponenten bestaande uit moleculen met een enkele ringvorm, zoals benzeen, tolueen, ethylbenzeen en xyleen) en gechloreerde koolwaterstoffen, belangrijke verontreinigingen in Nederland. Veel grondwater in Nederland is zuurstofloos, en de twee genoemde types van verontreiniging hebben een verschillende functie voor microorganismen: monoaromatische oliecomponenten zijn elektronendonoren (vergelijkbaar met de functie van voedsel voor mensen) en gechloreerde koolwaterstoffen zijn elektronenacceptoren (vergelijkbaar met de functie van zuurstof voor mensen. Het onderzoek is gedaan in een multidisciplinaire samenwerking tussen de drie bovengenoemde universiteiten, waarbij ecologie, microbiologie, milieuchemie en statistiek zijn gecombineerd. In de biologie heeft de toepassing van zgn. moleculaire technieken de laatste jaren een sterke vlucht genomen. Deze technieken richten zich vooral op het specifiek waarnemen van een stukje erfelijke informatie (DNA), of het expressie-product ervan (mRNA), en het slim en snel vermenigvuldigen van die specifieke informatie met de zgn. PCR reactie. Deze aanpak stond ook centraal in dit project, maar werd gecombineerd met conventionele cultivatie van microorganismen en nieuwe technieken zoals labelen van vetzuren met zware isotopen, isotoop fraktionatie en het meten van tussenstoffen in de afbraak, om het inzicht in de afbraakroute van vervuiling te verhogen. 

Drie onderzoekslocaties zijn in detail onderzocht, met de meeste aandacht voor het ondergronds gebied stroomafwaarts van de Banisveld vuilstort, Boxtel, Noord-Brabant. Stroomafwaarts van deze vuilstort ligt een belangrijk nutriënt-arm natuurgebied, de Kampina. De structuur van de levensgemeenschappen in de ondergrond bleek vrij simpel, er zijn veel soorten bacteriën aanwezig terwijl het aantal eencellige organismen dat zich zou kunnen voeden met bacteriën, zoals protozoa, gering is. Grotere organismen, zoals kleine kreeftachtigen die in sommige gevallen het grondwater bevolken, waren hier afwezig. Over relatieve korte afstanden (meter schaal) bleek er een grote variatie tussen monsters te zijn qua aanwezigheid van soorten. Deze heterogeniteit in de samenstelling van levensgemeenschappen draagt bij tot de algemene biodiversiteit van de onderzoekslocatie en zou voordelig kunnen zijn voor de natuurlijke afbraak , omdat tijdens zijn loop door de ondergrond het grondwater, met daarin de verontreiniging, een grotere kans zou hebben de juiste omstandigheden en microorganismen tegen te komen die bijdragen aan de afbraak. Behalve een grote ruimtelijke heterogeniteit, werd ook een grote dynamiek in microbiële gemeenschappen over een periode van 6 jaar waargenomen. 

Ook de zuurstofloze afbraak van monoaromatische koolwaterstoffen, met ijzer als electronenacceptor is onderzocht voor de Banisveld locatie. De biodegradatie in vervuilde en schone referentie punten werd bepaald om het effect van eerdere blootstelling aan monoaromatische koolwaterstoffen op microbiële gemeenschappen en hun vermogen om die vervuiling af te breken, te achterhalen. We waren de eersten om aan te tonen dat p-xyleen kan worden afgebroken onder ijzerreducerende condities. In dit onderzoek was de toepassing van isotopen belangrijk. Vervuilingscomponenten, zoals tolueen, gelabeld met zware isotopen werden gebruikt om te achterhalen welke organismen die stoffen omzetten en hoe zij dat doen, doordat het label werd ingebouwd in de biomassa, vooral in vetzuren, maar ook in afbraakproducten. Deze gelabelde vetzuren en afbraakproducten werden vervolgens specifiek gedetecteerd en uit het type gelabelde vetzuur werd afgeleid welk soort 


het was. Deze analyses als ook de moleculaire karakterisatie, suggereren een rol van Geobacter in de afbraak. Daarnaast werd de eigenschap van microorganismen om vooral vervuiling die relatief veel lichte isotopen bevat, op te eten, gebruikt om te achterhalen hoe de biologische afbraak van vervuiling bij Banisveld, op basis van veranderingen in de ratio licht en zware isotopen verloopt met de afstand tot de vuilstort (isotoop fractionatie). 

Het tweede type vervuiling dat werd onderzocht, waren de gechloreerde koolwaterstoffen. Moleculaire methoden werden ontwikkeld om het afbraakpotentiaal van microorganismen die ademhalen met gechloreerde alifaten (anaërobe dehalogeneerders) te evalueren. Uniek in deze aanpak was dat we de functie van de microorganismen in hun natuurlijke omgeving onderzochten en niet zozeer hun identiteit. Dit werd gedaan door specifiek te kijken naar een gen dat essentieel is in de ademhaling met gechloreerde koolwaterstoffen en codeert voor het enzym dehalogenase. Een methodiek voor de snelle detectie en moleculaire vermenigvuldiging via een PCR is opgezet en gevalideerd aan de hand van een aantal laboratoriumstammen die ademhalen met gechloreerde alkanen (m.b.: zijn het alkanen of alkenen?), en monsters uit het veld. Aantallen en activiteit van de anaërobe dehalogeneerders zijn bepaald op basis van het 16S ribosomale RNA gen dat in elke bacterie aanwezig is en wordt gebruikt om evolutionaire verwantschap tussen organismen te bepalen, en het dehalogenase-gen dat het vermogen tot afbraak van gehalogeneerde koolwaterstoffen aangeeft. Hieruit is gebleken, dat hogere aantallen aan dehalogenerende populaties goed korreleerden met een verhoogd afbraakactiviteit in zogenoemde bioschermen, waar het afbraakproces door middel van substraatinjectie in de ondergrond gestimuleerd werd. 

De methodieken gebruikt en ontwikkeld in dit project kunnen bijdragen aan het voorspellen en volgen van natuurlijke afbraak bij andere vervuilde locaties en zullen bijdragen aan de management en actieve remediatie van andere vervuilde grondwater ecosystemen. 

De vervuilingspluim bij de vuilstort Banisveld lijkt zich gestabiliseerd te hebben, maar er is ook een indicatie verkregen, dat de pluim in de laatste jaren meer naar het oppervlakte is gekomen. Een systeem van extensieve monitoring lijkt gewenst. 

De resultaten zijn van belang voor bodembescherming en het evalueren van de natuurlijke afbraak van vervuiling: 

n.b.: zie mijn opmerking bij onderdeel 5 m.b.t. de navolgende issues! 

1. Er is bewijs verkregen voor de in situ (ter plekke) anaërobe afbraak van     monoaromatische oliecomponenten in een aantal vervuilde grondwater     ecosystemen, op basis van het meten van koolstofisotoop-fractionatie en     afbraakproducten in het veld en in vergelijking tot laboratoriumexperimenten. 

2. Een aantal (mengsels van) bacterie-soorten die betrokken zijn bij de afbraak van     belangrijke verontreinigingen zijn geïdentificeerd en gekarakteriseerd. De     aanwezigheid van deze soorten kan worden gemeten bij andere locaties. 

3. Met behulp van nieuw ontwikkelde, zogenaamde moleculaire methodes, is het nu     mogelijk de hoeveelheden en activiteiten van bacteriën betrokken bij biodegradatie 


 te bepalen op basis van functionele markers (genen betrokken bij de afbraak). Dit maakt het mogelijk om bioremediatie processen in situ te bestuderen en kennis te verkrijgen over wat de belangrijke factoren zijn die een gewenst proces (bv. afbraak) beïnvloeden. 

4. Mathematische modellen, gecombineerd met Ecologische Controle Analyse, kunnen     bijdragen tot nieuwe inzichten in het functioneren van het grondwaterecosysteem.     Het inzicht in het functioneren van het geheel systeem kan worden gebruikt om     verrassende nieuwe mogelijkheden in bodembescherming en bioremediatie te     ontwikkelen en te testen. Een voorbeeld daarvan is de (theoretische) mogelijkheid     van toepassing van bacterie-etende protozoa om bacteriële processen te     versnellen. 

5. Hydrogeochemie en de samenstelling van microbiële gemeenschappen (zowel in     het algemeen, als gericht op (aantallen behorende tot) een bepaalde groep) die     gehecht zijn aan sediment in de ondergrond kan (n.b. is gebleken ?) sterk variëren     over korte afstanden (meter-schaal) en met de tijd. Dit heeft consequenties voor     het nemen van monsters (het aantal monsters nodig om een vervuilde locatie goed     te kunnen beschrijven). Aan de andere kant, zou de grote heterogeniteit grotere     biodiversiteit kunnen onderhouden welke in zijn totaal beter in staat is om     vervuiling af te breken (n.b.: is deze laatste zin een vraag of een antwoord?). 

 07 What impact and relevance has this project’s outcome for practicing soil protection and/or soil remediation? Again, please motivate. 

In short, the major impacts and relevant outcomes for applications in soil protection and remediation can be divided in two groups: new knowledge and insights and new tools (or what not to do): 

New knowledge and insights 

1. Insight in the functioning of the system as a whole allows for alternative strategies in     soil protection and bioremediation: for example the (theoretical) potential of     bacteria-feeding protozoa to enhance the bacteria-mediated degradation of     pollutants, via nutrient-recycling. 

2. Hydrogeochemistry and subsurface sediment-attached microbial community structure     can vary dramatically over short distances (meter-scale) and reveals a large     heterogeneity in the pollutant-degrading community structure. This should be     reflected in sampling design (i.e. a requirement for a high number of samples n.b.:     zie mijn eerdere opmerking!). On the other hand the high environmental     heterogeneity may support a larger diversity of microorganisms capable of pollutant     degradation and therewith enhance natural attenuation. 

New (potential for) tools (or what not to do): 


3. Evidence was obtained for in situ BTEX degradation in different polluted aquifers,     based on measurements in microcosms and on groundwater samples (metabolites,     isotope fractionation) 

4. Some (consortia of) species (e.g Geobacter spp., Dehalococcoides spp.) indicative for     the occurrence of biodegradation have been identified; these species or their genes     involved in pollutant degradation can be monitored at other locations (see point 3). 

5. A method has been developed to quantify the abundance, as well as the metabolic     potential and activity of populations involved in biodegradation using functional     markers. It provides an important tool. This has allowed us to study bioremediation     processes in-situ and thus allowing to identify physico-chemical as well as biological     conditions that are required to promote and sustain effective clean-up. 

6. Monitoring the presence of multicellular eukaryotes in Dutch groundwater is not a     suitable tool to determine groundwater quality. Groundwater fauna was never?     observed in fine? sandy sediments (the majority of Dutch sediments where one can     expect pollution) and only infrequently in coarse sediments (e.g. gravel). 

n.b.: heeft Jos Notenboom ze nooit in grof zand aangetroffen? Als dat zo is, dan is het uitgangspunt van dit onderzoek, zoals destijds is geformuleerd m.b.t. een inventarisatie van een groot aantal soorten sedimenten op aanwezigheid van grondwaterfauna om de resilience vraag te beantwoorden, een verkeerde geweest! 

n.b.: hoe sluit het navolgende gedeelte aan bij het vorige en bij de vraagstelling van vraag 07? BTEX and chlorinated alkenes are characterised by a relatively high solubility in water and slow biodegradation rates under anaerobic conditions: they can pose a serious risk to the environment and, in the case of benzene, to human health. Therefore, the investigation of the ability of groundwater ecosystems to limit the effects of those pollutants is particularly relevant with respect to the decontamination or biodegradation activity that indigenous microorganisms can accomplish. The involvement of indigenous and relatively widespread micro-organisms in the removal of BTEX could surely have a positive effect in contaminated soil management, because if it can be demonstrated that the pollutants do not pose an immediate health threat and if they remain localised, the sediment does not need to be further treated. Laboratory incubations data must be corroborated by field investigations in order to prove that BTEX degradation is occurring. Different tools can be applied: pollutant and/or metabolite detection along the groundwater flow or natural isotopic fractionation. Both approaches were tested and the latter surely offers a novel and easy tool for determining whether in situ degradation takes place. These measurements are easily combined with molecular analysis, to determine the presence and activity of specific types of micro-organisms to obtain a far more complete picture on what is happening in groundwater systems.

 Part II 

 Detailed information, primarily intended for administrative and statistical use by NWO-ALW 

 11a Under item 5 you have filled in the main research objectives. Please list all the original research objectives as indicated in the project’s application and both indicate as well as motivate, to what extent these goals were realised, and/or whether the original research objectives had to be adapted. 

Here, the detailed objectives are given, as extracted from the research proposal. As question 12 appears to overlap with the second part of this question (realisation of objectives), the realisation or matching of results to objective is given only here. 

The overall objectives of the proposed research were to characterise the in situ biodegradation of selected contaminants in subsurface (groundwater) ecosystems in relationship to the geochemistry and microbial ecology of these systems and to contribute to the development of a combined geochemical, ecological and environmental chemical framework for the evaluation of the natural attenuation capacity of subsurface environments. 

The proposed research originally consisted of four main activities: 

1. Determination of biogeochemical redox-reactivity of the subsurface in relation to     sediment characteristics (lithofacies data). Research analist at VUA/TNO-NITG (de     Gans, van Verseveld). 

2. Using the established biogeochemical redox-reactivity of the subsurface sediments     for the determination of their relation to occurring eukaryotic and microbial     communities. AIO subproject a at VUA (van Straalen, van Verseveld/Röling) 

3. Detection of the occurrence and in-situ activity of bacteria in deep groundwater     and subsoil samples by using molecular methods. AIO subproject b at WU     (Akkermans/Smidt) 

4. Determination of resilience/reactivity of specific populations in microbial     communities using 13C tracer analysis and labelling of DNA with various     nucleotides of DNA upon growth after a stimulus. AIO subproject c at UvA/VUA     (Parsons , Lingeman, van Verseveld). 

Below the research objectives are given per subproject, in italics, and their achievement and/or modifications. 

Ad (2). Project of Traian Brad (VUA) + analist (VUA/TNO). Eukaryote community structure in relation to microbial community structure and hydrochemistry 


1. Generate data from a comparison of sites with different anthrophogenic activities at     the surface. The request for an analist for doing hydrochemical analysis was not     awarded. Therefore, it was decided to analyse two sites in detail instead of 20 sites. 

2. Sampling, identification and molecular characterization of groundwater fauna.     Metazoa were only encountered at one research location, and there only at one     groundwater sampling well. Therefore this research objective has been adapted     towards analyzing the spatial and temporal dynamics in community structure of     smaller eukaryotes (e.g. protozoa). A detailed characterization was obtained for     Banisveld landfill polluted aquifer. Flagellate protists have been identified in the     most polluted part of the aquifer at Banisveld, and this suggests the indirect, but     important contribution of protists to biodegradation, by feeding on bacteria and     recycling of limiting nutrients, stimulating bacterial growth, the substrate uptake     rate, biodegradation. 

3. Characterisation of microbial groundwater communities using molecular and     physiological fingerprinting methods. The spatial and temporal dynamics in bacterial     community structure were analysed in large detail for the aquifer downstream of the     Banisveld landfill. In addition the interaction between protozoa and bacteria with     respect to the rate of biodegradation of pollutants were determined. 

4. Analysing the microbial diversity in animal guts. See point 2, since only in one case     metazoa were found, in low numbers, this objective was not further addressed. 

5. To contribute to the ecological theory on the relationship between genetic (and     physiological) biodiversity and ecosystem resilience. We have obtained complex     bacterial and eukaryotic communities and relatively high (genetic) diversity of both     bacteria and eukaryotes in the polluted aquifer from Banisveld. Ecological theory     says that the higher the biodiversity, the higher resilience of ecosystems. The longer     the food chains are the higher resilience. Since only a limited number of sites were     characterized (see point 1), it is difficult to generalize the results. An essay     addressing the ecological basis of the resilience concept and its application to     groundwater remediation is part of the PhD thesis of the candidates 

 n.b.: doet Trajan mee aan de voorgenomen publicatie m.b.t. resilience van Meta en Sabrina (zie publikatielijst, nr 9)?. 

Ad (3). Project by Meta van Heusden (WUR). Detection of the occurrence and in-situ activity of bacteria in deep groundwater and subsoil samples by using molecular methods. The main objective has been to detect the in-situ activity of bacteria in deep groundwater and subsoil samples by detecting the mRNA of the key enzymes in respiration with halogenated compounds, nitrate or sulphate as electron acceptors: 

1. extraction and characterisation of reductive dehalogenase mRNA’s (optimise     DNA and RNA extraction procedures; amplification by existing primer sets and     study diversity of gene fragments by DGGE and cloning and sequencing, use     competitive PCR for quantification and construct expression gene libraries).     The optimisation of DNA and RNA extraction was successful. With respect to     the application of existing primers for catabolic gene amplification, however, it     was found in the course of the project that existing primer sets were not     entirely suitable for reaching the goals. This related mainly to the fact that     new sequence information was increasingly becoming available and it was 


 decided to redesign the existing primers and design new primers using the new database of information. The primers were validated also for use in realtime PCR and used on environmental (soil and groundwater) samples. 

2. characterisation of key genes involved in nitrate and sulphate respiration     (using available primer sets; design specific PCR primers using the newly     available sequence information; correlate the occurrence of genes involved in     nitrate and sulphate respiration and their mRNAs with the redox condition of     the sample). Because redesigning and validating required significant attention     and time, it was decided to focus only on the detection of halorespiring     organisms. The strategy included the detection based on 16S rRNA genes of     certain phylogenetic groups of halorespiring bacteria. DGGE profiling of the     dehalogenase genes proved practically not possible, and different methods     were considered, including RFLP. This remark also applies to the next two     points. 

3. development of expression libraries (from contaminated and uncontaminated     sites). 

4. development of DNA arrays for key genes in anaerobic respiration (using the     expertise obtained from arrays on 16S rDNA aimed at detecting bacteria in     anaerobic sludge). 

Ad (4). Project by Sabrina Botton (UvA). Determination of resilience/reactivity of specific populations in microbial communities using 13C tracer analysis and labeling of DNA with various nucleotides of DNA upon growth after a stimulus. 

1. Characterisation of microbial consortia obtained from subsurface core samples from     contaminated and uncontaminated sites under laboratory conditions for their ability     to degrade contaminants. The potential for BTEX biodegradation was investigated in     two polluted aquifers, Banisveld and Limburg, characterised by iron and nitrate     reducing conditions respectively. Evidence for degradation of benzene, toluene and     the three xylene isomers with iron as electron acceptor was obtained in sediment     and groundwater microcosms incubations and bacteria involved in the BTX oxidation     were further enriched. Benzene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene removal with nitrate as     electron acceptor was detected in groundwater microcosms for Limburg and     maintained in enrichment cultures. 

2. Identification of BTEX degrading cultures. 13 C trace analysis in combination with     PLFA analysis, and molecular analysis (16S rRNA gene-based DGGE) confirmed the     involvement of Geobacteraceae in toluene degradation. The methodology applied for     identifying BTEX degrading bacteria (16S rDNA-based DGGE) was different from the     originally proposed one (immuno-capture of labelled nucleotides): in fact we found     DGGE profiling to be more suitable to answer the research question. 

3. Evaluation of the occurrence of biodegradation processes in situ. Chemical and     carbon isotope analysis of groundwater samples indicated very low BTEX levels (μg/l)     and enrichment in 13 C benzene and ethylbenzene along the plume, indicating     biological removal of those pollutants. 


 11b Did the project also include objectives which were not scientific? For instance, did the project also intend to apply research results, or strengthen the economic position of certain businesses? 

 The projects had a clear applied aspect, being directed towards the role of natural attenuation in the management of landfill plumes. However, we have pursued the scientific basis of natural attenuation rather than pursuing commercial applications. 

 11c Did the project’s aims include the expanding the (international) network of contacts (at what level), providing education, improve communication, serve as input for policy drafting or policy decisions, etc.? Please motivate. 

The results of this programme have been disseminated widely in the scientific community (see list of publications above). In addition, direct contacts with consultancy companies and organisations for strategic applied research have been maintained by regular meetings of the utilization committee supervising the programme. n.b.: + 2 SKB/TRIAS-workshops m.b.t. NA met deelname van onderzoekers en deskundigen van adviesbureaus 

 12 Do the results obtained match the original objectives? Please provide a short motivation why they do or don’t. 

 This question largely repeats question 11. In short, results obtained match the original objectives, but some objectives needed to be modified seriously. These modifications were discussed with the programme committee. Since an analyst was not awarded in the project, far less locations were investigated than stated in the research proposal and obliterated answering the resilience question as originally intended. 

 13 Will the results of this project serve as input for an initiative integrating/and or generalizing input from several projects, for instance into a (numerical) model, or into more understanding at the higher/system level? If so, was this intended and optimised from the beginning or did it occur by chance/ spontaneous? Please elaborate. 

The following results and approaches serve(d) as input for integrating several projects and 

understanding at the higher/system level: 

**1.** As the three PhD students in this project worked together on samples obtained     from two research sites, the natural attenuation could be addressed in large     detail (especially for Banisveld) and knowledge was obtained on the system     level (tropic structure, community structure and activity, isotope fractionation,     biodegradation) 


**2.** Co-sampling on Banisveld with another TRIAS project (845.080.004) was     performed, in order to achieve an even more in-depth characterisation of the     microbial communities and processes. 

**3.** In another TRIAS project (845.080.004), work was done on a new theoretical     framework in microbial ecology (Ecological control analysis). Especially, prey-     predator interactions were experimentally tested together, and to a lesser     degree syntrophic interactions (e.g. fermenting microorganisms and     halorespirers). 

**4.** Links to new projects, including the BSik-supported programme on     Ecogenomics and several EU-funded projects were established. 

Integration with other projects has been achieved from the start, especially with two other TRIAS projects (845.080.004, Reactivity of iron-oxyhydroxides, involving among others Bin Lin and Wilfred Röling (both VUA); 835.080.121, CORONA: Confidence in forecasting of natural attenuation, involving among other Maurice Luijten and Jan Gerritse (TNO-MEP)). In the latter project work was also done on halorespiration, in close collaboration with Meta van Heusden and Hauke Smidt (WU) and joined TRIAS meetings were held to enhance optimal integration of the data. The former project also dealt with one of the research sites of this project, the Banisveld landfill-leachate polluted aquifer, Boxtel. Field sampling has occurred simultaneously, and PhD students of the two projects have worked on the same samples, in order to get very detailed and integrative information on microbial communities and activities. Bin Lin (VUA) worked on iron-reduction, work that closely related to that of Sabrina Botton (UvA) on BTEX degradation under iron-reducing conditions. Traian Brad (VUA) worked on eukaryotic communities, with emphasis on predation. Combining the two projects Wilfred Röling (VU) has modelled the effects of predation on bacteria-mediated degradation processes. Within the ‘resilience’ cooperation it was attempted as much as possible to work on the same samples from two research locations, in order to be able to integrate the data as much as possible to get fuller insight into the process of natural attenuation. The molecular tools for the detection of abundance, as well as biodegradative potential and activity of anaerobic dehalogenating populations, which were developed by Meta van Heusden (WUR) formed the basis for the integration with recently initiated programmes in which the group of Hauke Smidt (WUR) is involved. These include the Ecogenomics programme, in which also the VU researchers participate, as well as two EUfunded projects. The integrative analysis of data collected in the framework of these different projects will be useful to further define characteristics of subsurface microbiota for successful bioremediation. This can be seen as the definition and exploitation of the bioremediative capacity of the living soil. 

 14 To what extent has this research project pointed the way in which further research has to be undertaken? Please motivate the guiding role perceived. 

This research project has pointed the way in which further research has to be undertaken to answer the following questions or achieve the following requirements: 

1. How does subsurface heterogeneity in microbial community structure and     hydrogeochemistry affect the potential for natural attenuation? 


2. At which sub-meter scale (cm, mm, um) are microbial communities auto-correlated     and what are the underlying causes for spatial and temporal heterogeneity in     microbial communities. 

3. Development of DNA arrays for high throughput phylogenetic and functional     profiling of subsurface populations relevant for bioremediation is required to link     intracellular processes to intercellular processes and interactions with the abiotic     environment. 

4. Integrative analysis of contaminated and unpolluted sites to get insight in how     processes are influenced and how they can be managed to get a desired end result. 

5. How versatile are microorganisms towards the degradation of different BTEX     compounds? 

6. Is degradation of a mixture of compounds affected by synergistic or antagonistic     interactions? 

7. What are the threshold values for degradation of pollutants, and in how far to these     depend on environmental conditions (redox process, presence of other pollutants,     groundwater chemistry)?     n.b.: ik meen, dat destijds door Marijke Tros en anderen al is aangetoond, dat drempelwaarden niet bestaan, maar zeer trage afbraak of restconcentraties vooral moeten worden verklaard door geringe mobiliteit of opsluiting van verontreiniging in bodemdeeltjes, waardoor ze onbereikbaar zijn voor micro-organismen. Hoe zit dat? 

8. What determines the stability of genetic elements involved in biodegradation within     bacterial cells, and under which conditions are these elements lost? 

9. Theory needs to be tested in practice, in an iterative manner. Once proven in the     laboratory, evidence for in situ occurrence needs to be obtained. 

In order to enhance the understanding of complex ecological processes, the system as a whole (community structure, activities of individual members and interactions between the different members, as well as with their environment, the chemical and physical structure of the environment) should be studied, not just its parts, or just those parts which are now considered important (e.g. the pollutant degrading microorganisms in biodegradation). Not only the activity of contaminant-degrading (micro)organisms should be considered in natural attenuation and biodegradation, but also the microorganisms that affect the activities of these microorganisms (e.g. predators, competitors, electron-accepting microorganisms) and environmental conditions (e.g. presence of more favourable substrates for pollutant degrading microorganisms, subsurface heterogeneity). This can only be achieved by a multidisciplinary approach, such as employed in this project, preferentially extended with the inclusion of theoretical ecology and hydrology/hydrochemistry. 

15. In what way, and to what extent, are the results reached of importance to research     done by others? Please motivate or elaborate. 

See also the previous answer. Systems complexity (such as processes like natural attenuation) needs to be addressed in a multidisciplinary manner, involving microbiologists, environmental chemists, hydrologists, geochemists, ecologists, molecular biologists and environmental engineerers. 


 Also, this project has contributed to the development of a toolbox for the cultivationindependent detection of organisms involved in biodegradative processes. The general setup of the toolbox can be adapted for other groups of organisms. 

 The research has provided new insight in the ability of anaerobic microorganisms to degrade different pollutants (para-xylene) under iron reducing conditions. This important novel finding needs to be further addressed in order to understand which bacteria are responsible of this process. 

 Moreover, it is also important to further evaluate the role of a specific group of microorganisms (Geobacteraceae) that seems to be involved in the removal of more than one pollutant. 

 16 Are you aware of any essential gaps or obstacles standing in the way of applying the results from your research project? Please elaborate. 

 We have identified the following gaps: 

1. Technical limitations of the methods like DNA and RNA extraction greatly influence the     results, for example by the detection limits etc. 

2. To be able to interpret results fully in relation to determining in situ conditions, an     integrative approach is needed, combining results from different approaches and     different toolboxes (e.g. determination of isotope fractionation and degradation     metabolites, pollutant degradation rates, molecular assessment of numbers and activities     of specific groups of microorganisms, trophic/microbial interactions in ecological     networks) 

Answers to the research questions stated under question 17 will certainly also contribute to optimal application of our results. 

 17 Which new research questions were generated through this project? Were these new questions addressed within this research project itself? Or will these new questions, or the results from your research project lead to new research projects (to be) funded by either 1st, 2nd,or 3rd^ category funding or funding through international funding agencies? Please elaborate. 

 New questions that still need to be addressed: 

1. At which sub-meter scale (cm, mm, um) are microbial communities auto-correlated     in subsurface aquifers, and at Banisveld in particular. Are similar degrees of     temporal and spatial heterogeneity in microbial communities and hydrochemistry     also found in other polluted aquifers, or does it for example depend on the type of     aquifer (e.g. sandy aquifer directly under the surface vs. sandy aquifer underneath     a layer of clay)? 


2. What are the underlying causes for temporal and spatial heterogeneity in     subsurface microbial communities (e.g. does it depend on the size of sediment     particles, the organic matter bound to sediment particles, changes in groundwater     chemistry, does it relate to chance processes). 

3. Do spatial and temporal heterogeneity indeed contribute to a better attenuation of     pollutants compared to a relatively more homogeneous environment? 

4. Although it is possible to enrich iron-reducing consortia capable of benzene     degradation, benzene appears relatively recalcitrant at Banisveld (present in 30 year     old groundwater). What are the underlying causes for this. How versatile are micro-     organisms towards the degradation of different compounds (e.g. which compounds     can they consume besides benzene, what are the sources of these compounds)?     How is degradation of a mixture of compounds affected by synergistic or     antagonistic interactions? Up till which threshold is benzene still degraded and which     factors influence these thresholds? 

Some questions have been addressed within the project or are being addressed in new projects. Already addressed in this project: 

Due to the absence of large groundwater fauna a shift was made to the characterisation of microeukaryotes. This led also to new questions regarding how microeukaryotes could influence microbial degradation of organic matter, and under which environmental conditions (especially the type of nutrient limitation), which were subsequently addressed in the project. 

Other new research questions, already being addressed new in other 3rd^ category programmes, relate to: 

1. Involvement of genetic, potentially mobile elements in the     evolution and adaptive capacity of halorespiring organisms – as a     link to understanding the adaptive capacity of the soil in response     to the pollution wit halogenated compounds. This is now addressed     in the Ecogenomics programme (Smidt, WU) 

2. Biogeography: how universal are the results obtained in this     project: are the same types of halorespirers or Geobacters found     everywhere. This is also addressed in the Ecogenomics programme     (Smidt, WU/Röling, VUA) 

 18 In what way did you link this project to other projects within the TRIAS-program or link it to projects outside TRIAS? Did you cooperate within the TRIASprogram and did this cooperation lead to integrated results? 

See also answers to question 12, 13. We cooperated with the TRIAS project on the Reactivity of iron-oxyhydroxides (845.080.004; involving Bin, Röling). This is leading to integrated results and co-authored manuscripts (Röling/Brad/Van Straalen, 


Botton/Parsons/Röling) are in preparation. The same holds true for TRIAS project 835.80.121 (Luijten, Gerritse), which was linked to our project via combined progress report meetings. Furthermore, actual integration with this project was achieved on the research level, which will lead to joint scientific output (Luijten/Gerritse/van Heusden/Smidt). Furthermore, at the VUA two projects, performed in Indonesia, are ongoing, which deal with landfill leachate pollution and associated redox processes. The research on molecular monitoring of the potential and occurrence of BTEX and PCE/DCE degradation will be continued at the VU (Röling) and WU (Smidt) in the BSIK-founded Ecogenomics programme, while monitoring of presence of microeukaryotes will also be part of this programme. Research results obtained in this project has also led to the participation of WU (Smidt) in two EU projects within the 6 th^ framework programme. Specifically, within the AQUATERRA project, molecular ecological approaches are used to assess the impact of (globally) changing environmental conditions affect microbial degradation potential and activity, while in the SEDBARCAH project similar methods are used to investigate the role of the sediment zone as a barrier against the infiltration of chlorinated aliphatic pollutants into surface water. 

 19 Can you elaborate on the impact on society as a whole of your results (e.g. societal organisations, NGO’s, businesses, schools, municipal authorities, etc.) 

Several potential applications for soil protection and remediation, of use for problem owners, have already been mentioned above (e.g. in the general summary and in the Dutch Summary). 

Overall, our results have contributed to a better insight in natural attenuation and how to monitor its potential and in situ occurrence. This allows now for better assessing Natural Attenuation and determining whether a polluted sites needs to be remediated or not. This should help to diminish the number of sites that need to be cleaned up and therewith lower costs for society as a whole. 

 20 What actions were taken to disseminate the results in the direction of the general public, besides the usual scientific channels? 

Data and results of the project have been made available via a public webpage: [http://www.bio.vu.nl/geomicrob/TRIAS/](http://www.bio.vu.nl/geomicrob/TRIAS/) 

 21 Have the researchers involved obtained a new position or employment after the project came to an end? Please specify and elaborate! 

Traian Brad has gotten an extension of his contract at VUA till 31 December 2005. In 2006 he will resume working at his former Romanian employer: Institute of Speleology ‘Emil racovita’, Department of Cluj. [http://www.speleological-institute-cluj.org/](http://www.speleological-institute-cluj.org/). Sabrina Botton is looking for a postdoc position. Meta van Heusden will be employed till mid December. All other scientific staff involved will continue their work at their respective universities.

## APPENDIX: 

 As part of the programme, the three PhD students wrote an essay on the concept of resilience and its application to natural attenuation of pollution from landfill plumes. A summary of this essay, which is part of the three PhD thesis, is attached to this report. 


Essay on the resilience of ecosystems: Emphasis on the groundwater ecosystem 

M. van Heusden, S. Botton & T. Brad 

SUMMARY 

In the context of our project, studying the resilience of the groundwater ecosystem in reaction to anthropogenic disturbances, it is important to look at what determines the resilience of an ecosystem. Resilience is a term that, in the case of groundwater systems contamination, implies more than assessing the degradation potential of a specific pollutant, but rather aims at describing the effects of the introduction of such pollutant on the whole ecosystem functioning. Two different definitions of resilience are commonly used in ecology and this distinction reflects which aspect of stability is emphasized: “engineering resilience” concentrates on stability near an equilibrium steady state; resistance to disturbance and speed or time of return to the equilibrium are used to measure the property. In contrast “ecological resilience” relates to conditions far from equilibrium steady state and resilience is the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before the system changes its structure by changing the variables and processes that control its behaviour. Resilience of ecosystems may be studied in theory by determining a stable point, applying a disturbance, measuring the time needed for the community to return to the previous state or to a new stable one and then repeating the experiment for communities in different environments. In practice, however, it is not such an easy task. It is clear that the definition of resilience is intimately linked to the definition of stability. When looking at the groundwater fauna the groundwater ecosystem is assumed to be relatively little resilient, because of the limited number of links in the food web and low overall biodiversity. Populations of groundwater fauna typically have grouped distribution and present K type-selection strategy. In many cases only one population of a species is present, leaving little means for recovery once affected by pollution. Groundwater organisms are generally stenobiontic, they only tolerate narrow environmental fluctuations, and thus they are vulnerable to disturbance. The degree of resilience also depends on the type of groundwater environment examined, but a return of the ecosystem to the original state is less feasible, due to the occurrence of irreversible processes (e.g. redox processes). Adaptation and speciation in aquifers (groundwater ecosystem) occur mainly due to this geographic isolation. This means that every aquifer is unique, and a nominal state after a perturbation can never be regained. The groundwater ecosystem cleans sooner or later, but the community may never be the same again. Secondary succession may occur when the environment is not severely isolated. When assessing resilience in subsoil and groundwater ecosystems with respect to the microbial community structure, not many studies have described this, moreover, the necessary simplification required to approach such studies has inevitably brought to “collapse” the microbial community into one (bacteria) or few functional groups (for example, nitrogen fixers, decomposers, methanogens) and very few studies have described stability and resilience in a microbe dominated ecosystem. An additional dimension of the role of microbial diversity in natural systems is related to the microbial adaptations to spatial and temporal variations in the environment. It is difficult to study the adaptation of these 


organisms through genetic evolution in whole ecosystem context; however, it could be a very important factor in any resilience study. We discuss the actual applicability of the existing concepts and hypotheses of resilience in relation to groundwater fauna and its possible translation for those ecosystems in which microbial communities should not be ignored, as in the case of groundwater ecosystem.
