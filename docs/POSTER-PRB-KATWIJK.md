## Introduction 

## A Dutch consortium is introducing a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) in the Netherlands for the treatment 

## of groundwater contaminations with chlorinated solvents. The project is for Dutch practices innovative 

## because it will be the first continuous PRB in the Netherlands, which is filled with zero valent iron. The 

## parties who join the Dutch consortium are Grontmij the Netherlands, the province of Zuid-Holland, 

## contractor NTP Milieu, institute TNO and ETI from Canada. The demonstration project will be carried out 

## with subsidy of the Netherlands Centre for Soil Quality Management and Knowledge Transfer (SKB). 

# Demonstration of a Permeable Reactive Barrier 

# at Katwijk the Netherlands 

## Katwijk Site 

## At the site of a former drum cleaner in Katwijk a 

## contamination with chlorinated solvents is present in 

## the shallow groundwater. The groundwater 

## contamination plume forms a thread for a public 

## garden complex that is situated about 100 m down 

## streams of the location. From a feasibility study the 

## application of a PRB turned out to have a good 

## protection for the public garden complex. 

## PRB construction 

## The PRB will be constructed at the site over a length of 180 m by a chain-saw trencher till a depth of 5.5 m 

## bgs. The soil structure is perfect for a PRB because there is a clay layer present at the bottom of the PRB. 

## Simultaneously with the excavation, the trench is immediately refilled with iron. The zero valent iron is 

## produced by Gotthart Maier (Germany) and is estimated to perform for more than 15 years. The PRB will 

## be filled at least with 20% iron and 80% sand. In the design side wings of foil are provided to reduce the 

## amount of iron.

## Column test 

## A column test with granular iron has been carried out 

## with groundwater from the site by Vito to estimate 

## the half-live and residence time for degradation. The 

## average half-live for the decisive component c-DCE 

## is 10.4 hours from the column test. The average 

## residence time for the PRB has been calculated at 

## 67 hours.
