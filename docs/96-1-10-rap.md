## SAMENVATTING 

 In situ bioremediation of soil contaminated with monochlorobenzene and aniline 

 A microbiological study 

Dit rapport is het verslag van het binnen het NOBIS-project 'Biologische in situ sanering met een combinatie van afbreekbare verontreinigingen' uitgevoerde microbiologische onderzoek. Hoofddoelstelling van dit project is het vaststellen van de mogelijkheden voor biologische afbraak van monochloorbenzeen en aniline en de optimale omstandigheden voor dit afbraakproces. 

Op een deel van de locatie van de chemische industrie ICI Holland BV te Rozenburg bevindt zich een bodemverontreiniging die hoofdzakelijk bestaat uit monochloorbenzeen (MCB) en aniline (AN). Om de vraag te kunnen beantwoorden of in situ bioremediatie in dit geval een geschikt saneringsconcept kan zijn, was (microbiologisch) onderzoek noodzakelijk. Het microbiologisch onderzoek richt zich op de afbraakprocessen van MCB en AN en de invloed van verschillende redoxomstandigheden op deze afbraakprocessen. 

Het gehele project is verdeeld in drie subfasen: 

1. karakterisatie en monstername door middel van veldonderzoek; 

2. literatuuronderzoek en laboratoriumexperimenten naar de omstandigheden waaronder bio-     logische afbraak kan optreden; 

3. interpretatie van resultaten en vertaling naar saneringsmogelijkheden. 

In dit rapport wordt alleen ingegaan op de resultaten van de tweede subfase: 

**a. Resultaten van het literatuuronderzoek** Een overzicht van de huidige beschikbare informatie over biologische afbraakprocessen van monochloorbenzeen, aniline en hieraan gerelateerde (halo)aromatische verbindingen, de organismen die hierbij betrokken zijn en de omstandigheden waaronder afbraak kan plaatsvinden. 

**b. Resultaten van het laboratoriumonderzoek** Nadat biologische activiteit van de van nature in de bodem aanwezige micro-organismen was aangetoond, is de invloed van verschillende omstandigheden (nutriÎnten, elektronenacceptoren, temperatuur, enz.) op de afbraakkinetiek van monochloorbenzeen onderzocht in batch slurries, batch enrichments, grondkolommen en continue systemen. Het onderzoek was hoofdzakelijk gericht op de invloed van zuurstof, nitraat en aniline op de afbraaksnelheid van monochloorbenzeen. 

**a. Literatuuronderzoek** _Chloorbenzenen_ Onder anoxische condities worden chloorbenzenen door anaÎrobe bacteriÎn gebruikt als elektronenacceptoren. Reductie van polygehalogeneerde benzenen resulteert in lager gehalogeneerde benzenen: chlooratomen worden vervangen door waterstofatomen. Hoger gehalogeneerde benzenen kunnen makkelijker worden gereduceerd dan lager gehalogeneerde benzenen als gevolg van een negatiever Gibbs-vrij energieverschil ( _∆G_ 0') bij reductieve dechlorinering. Reductieve dechlorinering van gechloreerde benzenen wordt zowel onder methanogene als sulfidogene condities gevonden. Er zijn veel reincultures beschreven die in staat zijn om gechloreerde benzenen tot CO 2 en celmateriaal onder oxische omstandigheden te mineraliseren. Oxische afbraak van benzeen gaat via het tussenproduct catechol door de _ortho-_ of _meta-_ afbraakroute, terwijl afbraak van chloorbenzeen plaatsvindt via een aangepaste _ortho-_ afbraakroute. Ophoping van (toxische) intermediairen kan worden verwacht als benzeenafbrekende organismen per ongeluk chloor

 v 


benzeen omzetten via de _ortho_ of de _meta_ -route. Bij monochloorbenzeenconcentraties boven 3 4 mM (0,3 0,4 g/l) zijn veelvuldig problemen met toxiciteit waargenomen in reincultures. 

_Aniline_ Mineralisatie van aniline is aangetoond onder oxische, denitrificerende, ijzerreducerende en sulfaatreducerende omstandigheden. Aniline kan dienen als koolstof-, energie-, en stikstofbron. Lange lag-perioden worden waargenomen in anaÎrobe enrichments van aniline-afbrekende bacteriÎn (6 18 maanden). Toxiciteit is waargenomen bij anilineconcentraties van 0,5 mM. Onder oxische condities wordt aniline door een initieel aniline-oxygenase omgezet in catechol wat verder wordt afgebroken via ofwel de _ortho-_ ofwel de _meta-_ route. 

_Biologische afbraak van mengsels van xenobiotische aromatische verbindingen_ Mengsels van aromatische xenobiotische verbindingen kunnen zowel een stimulerend als een remmend effect hebben op elkaars biodegradatie. Metabolische afbraakroutes kunnen worden geremd en alternatieve afbraakroutes van substraten kunnen leiden tot vorming van toxische producten waaraan het organisme uiteindelijk zelf sterft. Aan de andere kant kunnen additionele substraten biodegradatie van primaire of secundaire substraten versnellen, doordat afbraak nu via specifieke geÔnduceerde routes zal plaatsvinden. 

_Biologische oxidatie van (halo)aromaten onder verschillende redoxcondities_ Biologische afbraak van aromaten is aangetoond onder denitrificerende condities (zowel in afwezigheid als in aanwezigheid van kleine hoeveelheden zuurstof), onder metaalreducerende condities, sulfidogene en methanogene condities. Er zijn echter geen gevallen gerapporteerd over de oxidatie van monochloorbenzeen onder anoxische condities. 

_Biologische behandeling van monochloorbenzeen_ Biologische afbraak van met monochloorbenzeen verontreinigd materiaal is aangetoond in afvalgassen, grond en grondwater. In grond verontreinigd met monochloorbenzeen en 1,2-, 1,3-, en 1,4-dichloorbenzeen is gestimuleerde afbraak verkregen door gebruik te maken van beluchting. Kleine hoeveelheden organisch materiaal (stro) en nutriÎnten zijn toegevoegd aan de bodem om de hier aanwezige bacteriepopulaties te stimuleren. Binnen een periode van 5 weken was meer dan 90 % van de chloorbenzenen afgebroken. 

**b. Laboratoriumonderzoek** De belangrijkste onderzoeksvragen en de in het laboratoriumonderzoek gevonden antwoorden worden hieronder gegeven. 

1. Zijn er levende micro-organismen op de verontreinigde locatie aanwezig en zijn deze organis-     men in staat om monochloorbenzeen en/of aniline af te breken?        Op de locatie is microbiologische activiteit gevonden. Hieronder bevonden zich zowel aniline- als        monochloorbenzeenafbrekende organismen. 

2. Hoe toxisch zijn monochloorbenzeen en aniline voor deze micro-organismen? 

 Monochloorbenzeen en aniline zijn niet toxisch tot concentraties van 10 mM. 

3. Verhoogd toevoeging van extra koolstofbronnen en nutriÎnten de afbraaksnelheid van mono-     chloorbenzeen?        Noch een positief noch een negatief effect kon worden waargenomen op de afbraaksnelheid van        monochloorbenzeen bij extra toevoeging van een koolstofbron of nutriÎnten. 

 vi 


4. Wat is het effect van de nevenverontreiniging aniline op de afbraaksnelheid van monochloor-     benzeen?        Aniline heeft een wisselend en soms inhibiterend effect op de afbraaksnelheid van monochloor-        benzeen. 

5. Vindt afbraak van monochloorbenzeen plaats onder anaÎrobe omstandigheden in de aan- of     afwezigheid van alternatieve elektronenacceptoren, zoals nitraat, metalen, sulfaat en koolstof-     dioxide?        Er vindt geen afbraak plaats van monochloorbenzeen onder anaÎrobe omstandigheden. Niet in de        aanwezigheid van alternatieve elektronenacceptoren en niet in de aanwezigheid van alternatieve        elektronendonoren. 

6. Wordt de afbraaksnelheid van monochloorbenzeen beÔnvloed door lagere partiÎle zuurstof-     spanningen?        Afnemende afbraaksnelheden van monochloorbenzeen zijn gevonden bij afnemende zuurstofcon-        centraties. 

7. Stimuleren additionele alternatieve elektronenacceptoren, zoals nitraat en sulfaat, de afbraak     van monochloorbenzeen onder lage zuurstofspanningen?        Additionele alternatieve elektronenacceptoren, zoals nitraat en sulfaat, stimuleerden de afbraaksnel-        heid van monochloorbenzeen bij lage zuurstofspanning niet, ondanks het feit dat wat nitraat werd        gereduceerd.

## SUMMARY 

 In situ bioremediation of soil contaminated with monochlorobenzene and aniline A microbiological study 

Within the framework of the Dutch NOBIS research program for _in situ_ bioremediation, a microbiological study has been performed to answer the question whether _in situ_ bioremediation is a suitable method for cleaning up a site contaminated with monochlorobenzene and aniline. The study therefore focuses on biodegradation of monochlorobenzene and aniline, and the influence of different redox conditions on the degradation processes. 

This report presents: 

**a. Results of a literature research** An overview of currently available information on biodegradation processes of monochlorobenzene, aniline and related (halo)aromatic compounds, the organisms that are involved in these processes, and the conditions under which degradation takes place. 

**b. Results of a laboratory study** Once biological activity of the indigenous microbes was shown, the influence of environmental conditions (nutrients, electron acceptors, temperature, etc.) on the degradation kinetics of monochlorobenzene has been investigated in batch-soil slurries, batch enrichments studies, soil columns and continuous systems. The main focus was to study the influence of oxygen, nitrate and aniline on the degradation rate of monochlorobenzene. 

**a. Literature research** _Chlorobenzenes_ Under anoxic conditions, chlorobenzenes are used as electron acceptors by anaerobic bacteria. Reduction of polyhalogenated benzenes results in lower halogenated benzenes: chlorine substituents are replaced by hydrogen atoms. Higher halogenated benzenes are more easily reduced than lower halogenated benzenes due to a more negative Gibbs free energy difference ( _∆G_ 0') upon reductive dechlorination. Reductive dechlorination of chlorinated benzenes is reported both under methanogenic and sulphidogenic conditions. Many pure cultures are described which are able to mineralize chlorinated benzenes to CO 2 and cell carbon under oxic conditions. Oxic degradation of benzene proceeds via catechol through the _ortho-_ or _meta-_ pathway whereas chlorobenzene degradation proceeds via a modified _ortho-_ pathway. Accumulation of (toxic) intermediates can be espected if benzene degrading organisms accidentally degrade chlorobenzene via the _ortho_ -pathway or the _meta_ -pathway. If the monochlorobenzene concentration exceeds 3 4 mM (0.3 0.4 g/l) toxicity problems were observed in pure cultures. 

_Aniline_ Mineralization of aniline has been shown under oxic, denitrifying, iron reducing and sulphate reducing conditions. Aniline can serve as carbon-, energy-, and nitrogen source. Long lag periods are observed in anaerobic enrichments of aniline degrading bacteria (6 18 months). Toxicity was observed above aniline concentrations of 0.5 mM. Under oxic conditions an initial aniline-oxygenase converts aniline into catechol which is further degraded via either the _ortho-_ or the _meta-_ pathway. 

_Bacterial degradation of mixtures of xenobiotic aromatic compounds_ Mixtures of aromatic xenobiotic compounds can have both stimilatory and inhibitory effects on their biodegradation. Metabolic pathways can be inhibited and misrouting of substrates may lead 

 viii 


to toxic (suicidal) products. On the other hand additional substrates may enhance biodegradation of primary or secondary substrates by improved induction of particular pathways. 

_Bacterial oxidation of (halo)aromatics under various redox conditions_ Biodegradation of aromatics has been shown under denitrifying conditions in the absence and presence of small amounts of oxygen, under metal reducing conditions, sulphidogenic and methanogenic conditions. However, no examples were found reporting on the oxidation of monochlorobenzene under anoxic conditions. 

_Biological treatment of monochlorobenzene_ Biological treatment of monochlorobenzene contaminated waste has been shown in waste gas, soil, and groundwater. In soil contaminated with monochlorobenzene and 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene degradation by indigenous microbes was obtained by using biostimulation and aeration. Low levels of organic material (straw) and nutrients were added to the soil to stimulate the indigenous population to degrade the chlorobenzenes. Within a period of 5 weeks more than 90 % of the chlorobenzenes (1 6 mg/kg) was degraded. 

**b. Laboratory study** The main questions asked for the laboratory study and their answers are shortly described below. 

1. Are viable microbes present at the polluted site, and are these indigenous microbes capable     of degrading monochlorobenzene?        At the polluted site microbial activity was found, as well as aniline and monochlorobenzene        degrading bacteria. 

2. How toxic are monochlorobenzene and aniline for these bacteria? 

 Monochlorobenzene and aniline are not toxic up to concentrations of 10 mM. 

3. Do additional carbon sources and nutrients enhance the degradation rate of monochloro-     benzene?        Neither a positive nor a negative effect of additional carbon sources and nutrients on the degradation        rate of monochlorobenzene was observed. 

4. What is the effect of the co-contaminant aniline on the degradation rate of monochloroben-     zene?        Aniline does have a variable, sometimes inhibiting effect on the degradation rate of monochloroben-        zene. 

5. Does monochlorobenzene degradation take place under anaerobic conditions in the absence     or presence of alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate, metals, sulphate and carbon     dioxide?        No degradtion of monochlorobenzene takes place under anaerobic conditions. Not in presence of        alternative electron acceptors and not in the presence of alternative electron donors. 

6. Is the degradation rate of monochlorobenzene influenced by low partial pressures of oxygen? 

 Decreasing monochlorobenzene degradation rates were found with decreasing oxygen concentrations. 

7. Do additional alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulphate enhance the mono-     chlorobenzene degradation under low oxygen concentrations?        Additional alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulphate did not enhance the mono-        chlorobenzene degradation rate with low partial pressure of oxygen, despite the fact that some        nitrate was reduced.

### CHAPTER 1 

## INTRODUCTION 

For the chemical company ICI Holland BV there exists a need to remediate a contaminated site comprising of soil polluted with a mixture of monochlorobenzene and aniline. Dispersion of these contaminants should be prevented. One method to prevent horizontal and vertical transport of the contaminants is the extraction of groundwater. An other method is _in situ_ bioremediation based on the use of the biodegradative capacities of indigenous microbes. Possibly dispersion of the contaminants can be prevented and even clean up of the site can be established by making the environmental conditions as favourable as possible for microbial degradation of the pollutants. **To answer the question whether** **_in situ_** **bioremediation will be a suitable method for cleaning up the polluted site, it is important to know which organisms are involved and under which conditions degradation occurs**. The biodegradation of monochlorobenzene and aniline and the influence of different redox conditions on the degradation processes have been investigated by means of a literature review and a laboratory investigation. 

_Main questions to be solved_ To answer the question whether _in situ_ bioremediation will be a suitable method for cleaning up a polluted site contaminated with monochlorobenzene and aniline, the main questions to be solved are the following: 

1. Are viable microbes present at the polluted site, and are these indigenous microbes capable     of degrading monochlorobenzene? 

2. How toxic are monochlorobenzene and aniline for these bacteria? 

3. Do additional carbon sources and nutrients enhance the degradation rate of monochloro-     benzene? 

4. What is the effect of the co-contaminant aniline on the degradation rate of monochloro-     benzene? 

5. Does the degradation of monochlorobenzene take place under anaerobic conditions with     alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate, metals, sulphate and carbon dioxide? 

6. Is the degradation rate of monochlorobenzene influenced by low partial pressures of oxygen? 

7. Do additional alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulphate enhance the mono-     chlorobenzene degradation under low oxygen concentrations? 

Chapter 2 will present the results of the literature review. Chapter 3 gives the practical approach followed for the laboratory research. Chapter 4 presents the results of the laboratory research. In chapter 5 conclusions for the laboratory results will be drawn. 



### CHAPTER 2 

## LITERATURE REVIEW 

2.1 **Introduction** 

The chemical company ICI Holland BV is confronted with the task to clean up a site contaminated with a mixture of monochlorobenzene and aniline. In any case, spreading of these contaminants must be prevented. One method to prevent horizontal and vertical migration of the contaminants is groundwater extraction. Another method is _in situ_ bioremediation based on the use of biodegradative indigenous microbes. By making the environmental conditions as favourable as possible for microbial degradation of the pollutants, the contamination can possibly both be prevented from spreading and even cleaned up. To answer the question whether _in situ_ bioremediation is a suitable method for cleaning up the polluted site, microbiological research is necessary. For that purpose, first an overview must be obtained of current knowledge on biodegradation processes of monochlorobenzene, aniline and related (halo)aromatic compounds. It is important to know what organisms are involved and under which conditions degradation takes place. The applicable information that was found is described below. 

2.2 **Monochlorobenzene** 

The haloaromatic compound monochlorobenzene is an aromatic ring in which one hydrogen atom is replaced by a chlorine atom. The chemical structure and main characteristics of monochlorobenzene are listed in table 1. The critical step in microbial degradation of halogenated aromatic compounds is cleavage of the halogen-carbon bond. For monochlorobenzene this can be established via two different processes: 1) reductive dehalogenation (see 2.2.1), and 2) dioxygenation reactions (see 2.2.2). After removal of the halogen, a natural non-halogenated substrate is formed which can be metabolized relatively easily. In general, successful biodegradation and the fate of haloaromatic compounds in nature depend on a) physico-chemical conditions at the contaminated site favouring a particular dehalogenation process, or a combination of dehalogenation processes, and b) the presence of bacteria capable of metabolizing these contaminants.

2.2.1 _Reductive dehalogenation of monochlorobenzene under anaerobic conditions_ During reductive dehalogenation the halogen attached to the aromatic ring is replaced by a hydrogen atom (see fig. 1). This process occurs almost exclusively under anoxic conditions (i.e. sulphidogenic and methanogenic) in which the halogenated benzene serves as a (terminal) electron acceptor for anaerobic bacteria [Commandeur and Parsons, 1990; H‰ggblom, 1990]. 

Fig. 1. Reductive dehalogenation of halobenzene to benzene. 

The more halogens are attached to the aromatic nucleus, the more it is thermodynamically favourable for the reductases, and hence the better they can dehalogenate the compound. The Gibbs free energy difference ( _∆G_ 0') upon reductive dechlorination of higher chlorinated benzenes is more negative than the difference in Gibbs free energy of reductive dehalogenation of lower chlorinated chlorobenzenes. Moreover, the ease with which microbiologically catalysed dehalogenations take place corresponds with the redox potential of the redox couples of the substrates involved. Redox couples which evoke the highest energy yield are used preferentially. Therefore, more highly halogenated aromatics, which have higher redox potentials relative to H+/H 2 than the reference system, are more easily reduced than lower halogenated aromatics [Beurskens et al., 1994; Dolfing and Harrison, 1993; Holliger et al., 1992]. As a result, dichlorobenzenes and monochlorobenzene often accumulate as end products from reductions of higher chlorinated benzenes, because it is less energetically favourable for bacteria to further reduce these compounds. For these reasons, mineralization of higher halogenated benzenes can best be established by a combination of anoxic and oxic degradation. Fathepure and Vogel [1991] described the reductive dechlorination and mineralization of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) by a combination of anaerobes and aerobes in a two-stage biofilm reactor. The extent of dechlorination was maximal when the anaerobic biofilm was supplied with acetate as the primary carbon source. HCB was dechlorinated to trichlorobenzenes. Trichlorobenzene was metabolized by the aerobic biofilm. Holliger et al. [1992] showed the reductive dechlorination of higher chlorinated benzenes (hexaand pentachlorobenzene, all three isomers of tetrachlorobenzene, 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene (1,2,3-TCB) and 1,2,4-TCB) in methanogenic mixed cultures. Hexapentaand tetrachlorobenzene were converted to trichlorobenzene; 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene was not dechlorinated and 1,3-dichlorobenzene was the main end product of the reductive dechlorination of 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene. The dechlorinating activity was only maintained as long as an electron donor was added. The best electron donors were lactate, ethanol, and hydrogen. The optimal temperature for dechlorination was 30 °C and the optimum pH was 7.2 [Holliger et al., 1992]. Beurskens et al. [1994] showed reductive dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene in anoxic methanogenic sediment originating from lake Ketelmeer and the river Rhine. Lactate served as the electron donor in these slurries. 

The optimal temperature for dechlorination was around 30 °C, but at 3 °C dechlorinating activity was still observed. Ramanand et al. [1993] described the reductive dechlorination of hexaand pentachlorobenzene and a mixture of tetra, triand dichlorobenzenes to monochlorobenzene in methanogenic soil. Monochlorobenzene accumulated as the end product. Biotransformation of alfa-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-hexachlorocyclohexane in a methanogenic flow-through column also yielded monochlorobenzene as the main product in the effluent [Middeldorp et al., 1996]. Nevertheless, reductive dechlorination of monochlorobenzene to benzene by a methanogenic mixed culture has been shown by Nowak and co-workers [1996]. However, the reduction of monochlorobenzene to benzene was very poor and took place only in the presence of trichloro


benzene as electron acceptor. The reductive process was stimulated by the addition of pyruvate, methanol, ethanol, acetone and acetate. Transformations of higher halogenated benzenes to lower halogenated benzenes were also shown under sulphidogenic conditions. Monochlorobenzene was also the end product of the reductive dechlorination of trichlorobenzenes under anoxic conditions in columns packed with river Rhine sediment. High concentrations of sulphate (20 mM) did not inhibit the dechlorinating activity. Denitrifying conditions in these soil columns however prevented reductive dechlorination [Bosma et al., 1988]. Beurskens [1995] showed the reductive dechlorination of HCB to 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene after a lag period of 30 weeks in the presence of 5 mM sulphate. Only 1,3,5-trichlorobenze was further dechlorinated to 1,3-dichlorobenzene. Table 2 presents an overview from the literature of enrichments that reductively dehalogenated chlorinated benzenes.

Several aerobic bacteria have been isolated which are able to degrade mono-, di-, triand even tetrachlorobenzene. The general picture for aerobic degradation of chlorobenzenes is that these compounds are metabolized via chlorocatechols. Initial attack of a dioxygenase, which incorporates molecular oxygen into the aromatic ring, leads to the formation of chlorinated dihydrodiols. Subsequently, a chlorinated catechol is formed by the action of a dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, which is further metabolized via the _ortho_ -cleavage pathway via the initial action of catechol-1,2-dioxygenase. The chlorine atom is released during the formation of muconolactone (see fig. 2) [Haigler et al., 1992; Nishino et al., 1992; Reineke and Knackmuss, 1984]. The _meta_ -pathway is inactivated because chlorocatechols have an inhibiting effect on the enzyme catechol-2,3-dioxygenase [Bartels et al., 1984; Klecka and Gibson, 1981]. If chlorobenzenes are degraded accidentally via the _meta_ -pathway, toxic intermediates, such as 5-chloroformyl-2-hydroxypenta2,4-dionic acid, are produced which are suicidal for the cells. 


Fig. 2. Oxic degradation pathway of monochlorobenzene [Haigler et al., 1992; Nishino et al., 1992; Reineke and Knackmuss, 1984]. 

Gibson et al. [1968] showed that _Pseudomonas putida,_ grown on toluene as a source of carbon, converted chloro-, bromo-, iodo-, and fluorobenzenes to their corresponding 3-halocatechol. Reineke and Knackmuss [1984] described a bacterium, strain WR1306, that could use monochlorobenzene as sole source of carbon and energy. The bacterium was isolated by continuous culture enrichment. The enrichment was initially fed with benzene and over a period of nine months monochlorobenzene had gradually replaced benzene as the growth substrate. Enzyme measurements revealed that this strain metabolized monochlorobenzene via the modified _ortho_ pathway. In the modified _ortho_ -pathway the substituted catechol is cleaved by the pyrocatechase II-enzyme, resulting in the formation of chloro_cis,cis_ -muconate. In the classical _ortho_ -pathway, pyrocatechase I is the ring-fission enzyme, which is not active on substituted catechols [Dorn and Knackmuss, 1978]. Therefore, problems can be expected when organisms possess the pyrocatechase I-enzyme and not the II-enzyme. Substituted benzenes can be converted to their corresponding halocatechols by the initial dioxygenases of the classical _ortho-_ pathway. These enzymes do often have a broad substrate range. The halocatechols formed cannot be cleaved by the pyrocatechase I-system, leading to accumulation of toxic chlorocatechols or accidental misrouting via the _meta_ -pathway by the action of catechol-2,3-dioxygenase. Misrouting via the _meta_ pathway will ultimately result in cell death. Nishino et al. [1992] did HPLC analyses on culture fluid of glucose + monochlorobenzene grown cells of strain 12A7A and showed chlorobenzenedihydrodiol and 3-chlorocatechol accumulation. The initial enzymes could convert monochlorobenzene, but the organism possessed the pyrocatechase I-system leading to the accumulation of chlorocatechols. Accumulation of chlorocatechols could easily be recognized by the appearance of a black/brownish colour, due to auto-oxidation. However, the presence of organisms possessing the classical _ortho_ -pathway on a site contaminated with chlorinated benzenes should not necessarily be a problem as long as there are also organisms present that do possess the modified _ortho_ -pathway. 

Pyrocatechase II is also known to be a non-specific enzyme, so, accumulating chlorocatechols will readily be metabolized in such a mixed community. Additionally, the range of xenobiotic compounds that a mixed community can succesfully mineralize may even increase [Slater and Lovatt, 1984]. The presence of organisms possessing pyrocatechase II in microbial communities at such a contaminated site is therefore essential to establish mineralization. 


Monochlorobenzene can also be transformed into 4-chlorophenol. Probably this is due to induction and activity of monooxygenases or dehydratases. Burback and Perry [1993] demonstrated that propane grown cells of _Mycobacterium vaccae_ catabolized monochlorobenzene to 4-chlorophenol which was not further metabolized. In this way no mineralization of monochlorobenzene is achieved, but such co-oxidative and catabolic transformations can result in intermediates that are more amendable to biodegradation. 

Dichlorobenzenes are metabolized via the same modified _ortho_ -pathway as monochlorobenzene. A _Pseudomonas_ sp. capable of growth on 1,2-DCB converted it via a dihydrodiol into 3,4-dichlorocatechol. The dichlorocatechol was degraded via _ortho_ -cleavage to 2,3-dichloro_cis,cis_ muconate, and chloride was eliminated during subsequent lactonization followed by hydrolysis to form 5-chloromaleylacetate [Haigler et al., 1988]. De Bont et al. [1986] described an _Alcaligenes_ sp. capable of growth on monochlorobenzene, 1,3-DCB, and 1,4-DCB. This bacterium degraded 1,3-DCB through the dihydrodiol into 3,5-dichlorocatechol which was also degraded via the _ortho_ pathway yielding 2,4-dichloromuconic acid. Several strains of _Pseudomonas_ and _Alcaligenes_ degraded 1,4-DCB via 3,6-dichlorocatechol which is subsequently metabolized via _ortho_ -cleavage to 2,5-dichloromuconic acid [Oltmanns et al., 1988; Schraa et al., 1986; Spain and Nishino, 1987]. 

Chlorobenzenes and benzene are known to be inhibitory to several bacteria but can be used as carbon sources when dispensed at a low concentration or in the gaseous form [De Bont et al.,1986; Haigler et al., 1988; Nishino et al., 1992; Reineke and Knackmuss, 1984; Schraa et al., 1986]. When benzene and monochlorobenzene were supplied in the liquid form it even prevented growth of a chlorobenzene degrading bacterium, strain WR1306 [Reineke and Knackmuss, 1984]. Fritz et al. [1992] showed that concentrations exceeding 3.5 mM monochlorobenzene were toxic to _Pseudomonas_ sp. strain RHO1, due to co-operative toxicity of the substrate and the metabolite 3-chlorocatechol. _Pseudomonas putida_ GJ31 and strain WR1306 had toxic treshold concentrations of 3 mM [Oldenhuis et al., 1989] and 100 mg/l [Reineke and Knackmuss, 1984], respectively. Utilization of high concentrations of halogenated benzenes was shown for _Rhodococcus opacus_ GM14, a Gram positive actinomycete [Zaitsev et al., 1995]. This organism utilized a very wide range of haloaromatic compounds. It grew at very high concentrations: in saturated aqueous solutions of benzene, monochlorobenzene, and 1,3-, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene (up to 13, 3, 0.5 and 0.5 g/l, respectively). Specific growth rates on benzene and chlorobenzene (0.4 g/l) were 0.2 h-1, and a growth yield of 40 to 50 g (dry weight) per mol substrate used was achieved. Benzene derivatives could be introduced into the medium as liquids, crystals or vapors. 

Chlorinated benzenes can also be degraded by fungi. Yadav et al. [1995] described the degradation of monochlorobenzene and _o-, m-,_ and _p-_ dichlorobenzenes by _Phanerochaete chrysosporium_ , a white rot fungus. The rate of chlorobenzene degradation was 5.13 mg/liter/day, and at concentrations of 10 mg/l chlorobenzene substantial amounts of growth and degradation were observed. 

Under nutrient-rich culture conditions the degradation rate was higher than under nutrient-poor conditions. Oxygen depletion from the cultures resulted in slowing down of chlorobenzene degradation. In table 3 organisms known to utilize chlorinated benzenes under oxic conditions have been listed.

2.3 **Aniline** 

Aniline is a naturally occurring primary aromatic amine. The main characteristics of aniline are shown in table 4. 

Table 4. Characteristics of aniline. 

 structural formula: 

 molecular weight (g/mol): melting point (°C): boiling point (°C): relative density (water = 1): relative vapor density (air = 1): vapor pressure (mbar at 20 °C): water solubility (g/l at 20 °C): log P octanol/water: 

 93.1 -6 184.0 1.02 3.2 0.4 34 0.9 


Aniline can be degraded, both under oxic and anoxic conditions, by bacteria that can use aniline as energy, carbon and nitrogen source. However, during the manufacture of industrial products environmental concentrations of aniline can rise dramatically. On account of its toxicity, this compound therefore poses an obvious environmental risk. 

2.3.1 _Anaerobic degradation of aniline_ Only very few examples are known of anaerobic degradation of aniline. Anaerobic transformation of aniline and some halogen-substituted derivatives were shown for a _Parococcus_ sp., a facultative anaerobic denitrifying bacterium [Bollag and Russel, 1976]. The decomposition of aniline was related to growth of the bacterium. Complete mineralization of aniline to CO 2 and NH 3 with sulphate as an external electron acceptor was shown by Schnell et al. [1989]. _Desulfobacterium anilini_ oxidized aniline with stoichiometric reduction of sulphate to sulphide as shown in the equation below: 

### 2C 6 H 5 NH 2 + 7SO 4 2-^ + 8H 2 O → 12HCO 3 -^ + 7HS-^ + 2NH 4 +^ + 3H+ 

Enrichment of anaerobic aniline degrading bacteria, however, resulted in long lag periods. From freshwater sediment, even after 12 months, neither sulphide production nor bacterial growth was observed. Enrichments with marine sediment samples and 0.5 mM aniline formed detectable sulphide production after 6 months. _Desulfobacterium anilini_ , isolated from such a marine enrichment, had a doubling time of 72 hours. Initial concentrations of aniline exceeding 0.5 mM retarded growth, probably due to toxicity of the substrate. The amino nitrogen was released quantitatively as ammonia and could also cover the nitrogen need for synthesis of cell material. Degradation of aniline depended on the presence of CO 2. Initial carboxylation to 4-aminobenzoate probably occurred [Schnell and Schink, 1991]. Kazumi et al. [1995] reported the anaerobic degradation of aniline under iron reducing conditions in sediment enrichments. 

However, the activity in the enrichments could not be maintained with refeeding, possibly due to an inhibitory effect of accumulated metabolic products, or the lack of a cosubstrate which was subsequently depleted. Myers et al. [1994] studied the microbial potential for the anaerobic degradation of simple aromatic compounds in river sediments. After 18 months significant losses of aniline were shown in sediments amended with multiple electron acceptors, including manganese(IV) and Fe(III) oxides, indicating the presence of anaerobic aniline degrading microbes. Swindoll et al. [1995] showed aniline degradation under denitrifying conditions in soil slurries from a contaminated wetland. Aniline concentrations decreased on average from 44 mg/l to 5 mg/l in 19 days after an acclimation period of 16 days. Aniline degradation did not occur in slurries incubated under sulphate reducing and methanogenic conditions over a 103-day period. 

2.3.2 _Aerobic degradation of aniline_ Oxic degradation of aniline proceeds via catechol, which is further metabolized via either the _ortho-_ , or the _meta_ -pathway, similar to the degradation routes found for oxic degradation of benzene. Ammonia is released during the initial steps leading to the formation of catechol. Probably an initial aniline-oxygenase is involved in the conversion of aniline and some substituted derivatives into catechol. This was shown for a _Nocardia_ sp. [Bachofer et al.,1975] , _Rhodococcus_ sp. AN117 [Janke et al., 1988], a _Pseudomonas_ sp. JL2 [Latorre et al., 1984], and _Moraxella_ sp. G [Zeyer et al., 1985]. Kaminski et al. [1983] did a study on the degradation of aniline by _Rhodococcus_ sp. strain AN117 and _Pseudomonas_ sp. strain SB3. The first organism metabolized aniline exclusively by conversion to and _ortho-_ cleavage of catechol. The pseudomonad degraded aniline through the _meta_ -pathway by the activity of a constitutive _meta_ -cleavage pyrocatechase. The _meta_ -pathway was also used by _Pseudomonas_ sp. strain CIT1 which posessed high activities of the catechol-2,3-dioxygenase [Anson and Mackinnon 1984; Meyers, 1994]. Loidl et al. [1990] described the degradation of aniline and monochlorinated anilines by soil-born _Pseudo-_ 


_monas acidovorans_ strains. Initial aniline concentrations of 2.14 mM (0.20 g/l) were degraded within 30 hours by _Pseudomonas acidovorans_ CA28 which used aniline as carbon-, energy-, and nitrogen source. The generation time was 3.0 hours and a growth yield of 0.6 g/g carbon was achieved. No catechol-2,3-dioxygenase activity could be detected, but high activities of the catechol-1,2-dioxygenase were present, indicating the _ortho-_ pathway to be used for the degradation. Table 5 gives an overview of reports describing the oxidation of aniline under various redox conditions.

2.4 **Bacterial degradation of mixtures of xenobiotic aromatic compounds** 

Organic pollutants can interact and this can have both stimilatory and inhibitory effects on their biodegradation. Such interactions can be very important since most sources of pollution discharge a whole spectrum of substances. Whether multiple substrates can be degraded simultaneously depends on the pollutant concentration, active biomass concentration, temperature, pH, availability of nutrients and electron acceptors, microbial diversity (presence of appropiate metabolic pathways), and the toxicity of the individual substrates or intermediates. Especially when the mixture consists of structure analogues, simultaneous biodegradation of pollutants can be problematic. One substrate can inhibit a metabolic pathway that is needed for biodegradation of the other. Additionally, accidental conversion of structure analogues by enzyme systems (misrouting) may lead to decreased biodegradation, accumulation of intermediates, or production of suicidal products resulting in cell death. The simultaneous degradation of chloroand methylsubstituted aromatic substrates is for many bacteria impossible as the catabolic pathways are incompatible. Methyl-substituted aromatic substrates are generally degraded via the _meta_ -ringfission pathway, catalysed by catechol-2,3-dioxygenase. Chloro-substituted aromatic substrates are degraded via the modified _ortho-_ pathway [Dorn and Knackmuss, 1978; Knackmuss, 1984]. Bartels et al. [1984] and Klecka and Gibson [1981] showed the incompatibility of these pathways for _Pseudomonas putida_ strains. The catechol-2,3-dioxygenase of the _meta_ -pathway was inactivated by chlorocatechols. For the degradation of haloaromatics by genetically engineered microbes the removal of the _meta_ -pathway was needed [Reineke et al., 1982]. Methyl-substituted aromatics are misrouted via the modified _ortho-_ pathway if the _meta_ -pathway is absent, resulting in accumulation of methyl-muconolactone [Knackmuss et al., 1976]. Burback and Perry [1993] studied the biodegradation and biotransformation of groundwater pollutant mixtures by _Mycobacterium vaccae_. When toluene and benzene were present concomitantly, toluene was 


catabolized and benzene oxidation was delayed. Toluene promoted the degradation of styrene, but the degradation rate of toluene was lowered by styrene. 4-chlorophenol had an antagonistic effect on the ability of _Mycobacterium vaccae_ to degrade toluene, benzene and chlorobenzene. Burback et al. [1994] showed that metabolites of ethylbenzene, propylbenzene and chlorobenzene biotransformation (4-chlorophenol, 4-ethylphenol and propylphenol) inhibited toluene degradation by _Mycobacterium vaccae_ at concentrations of 0.2 mM, 0.4 mM and 0.4 mM, respectively. However, the authors did not speculate about inhibition or induction of specific enzymes involved. Yet, beneficial substrate interactions can occur by enhanced induction of specific catabolic pathways by additional substrates. For example, Arvin et al. [1989] showed that bacteria grown on tolueneand _o-_ xylene were able to degrade benzene, whereas naphtalene-, 1,4-dimethylnaphtalene-, and phenantrene-degrading bacteria did have no or very little benzenedegrading ability. However, the stimulating effect of toluene and _o_ -xylene was only true if the two compounds were present alone. If both were present an antagonistic effect was observed. Pettigrew et al. [1991] studied the simultaneous degradation of monochlorobenzene and toluene by a _Pseudomonas_ strain. This bacterium degrades monochlorobenzene via the modified _ortho_ pathway and toluene is metabolized via the _meta_ -pathway. However, when the organism was exposed to a mixture of monochlorobenzene and toluene, the _meta_ -pathway was strongly inhibited by the intermediate 3-chlorocatechol and toluene was metabolized via the same modified _ortho_ pathway used for the degradation of monochlorobenzene. 

_Pseudomonas_ sp. strain JS150 is capable of synthesizing at least four ring-fission pathways and three separate initial dioxygenases when grown on the appropriate single aromatic substrates [Haigler et al., 1992]. When strain JS150 was continuously grown on monochlorobenzene, it degraded mixtures of monochlorobenzene, benzene, toluene, naphtalene, trichloroethylene, and 1,2and 1,4-dichlorobenzenes. Phenol-grown cells degraded a mixture of phenol, 2-chloro-, 3-chloro-, and 2,5-dichlorophenol and 2-methyland 3-methylphenol. Some compounds that could not serve as growth substrates (chloroand methyl-substituted phenols, 1,3-dichlorobenzene and 4-chlorotoluene) were readily metabolized by chlorobenzene-grown cells without accumulation of transformation products. Probably enzymes are induced by chlorobenzene which allows the organism to derive carbon and energy from substrates that can not serve as primary growth substrates. Thus the induction of appropriate biodegradative pathways in strain JS150 permits the biodegradation of complex mixtures of aromatic compounds. Alvarez and Vogel [1991] described enhanced benzene degradation by the presence of low amounts (0.1 1 mg/l) of toluene by _Pseudomonas_ sp. strain CFS215. Strain CFS215 might utilize the same enzyme to degrade both benzene and toluene. The enhanced microbial activity is probably caused by induction of toluene dioxygenase with a broad substrate specificity. The presence of _p-_ xylene inhibited benzene degradation. However, when both toluene and _p_ -xylene were present with benzene, the enhancement of toluene outweighed the inhibition by _p_ -xylene resulting in a faster degradation of benzene than when benzene was present alone. In the same report these authors describe cometabolic degradation of toluene and _p-_ xylene by _Arthrobacter_ sp. strain HCB during growth on benzene. When benzene was omitted from the medium, no further disappearance of toluene and _o_ -xylene was observed [Alvarez and Vogel, 1991]. The white rot fungus _Phanerochaete chrysosporium_ can degrade toluene and monochlorobenzene when presented as a mixture [Yadav et al., 1995]. No mutual inhibition of degradation of these compounds was observed. They suggest that the chlorobenzeneand toluene degradation pathways share certain enzymes. 


2.5 **Bacterial oxidation of (halo)aromatics under various redox conditions** 

Aromatic hydrocarbons are readily degradable in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen plays a dual role during aerobic degradation. It serves as the final electron acceptor, but also as a cosubstrate in initial reactions catalysed by monoor dioxygenases. These enzymes incorporate one (monooxygenase) or two oxygen (dioxygenase) atoms derived from molecular oxygen into the aromatic ring. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate, sulfate or metals, like iron(III), manganese (IV) or Cr(IV) can substitute oxygen and serve as the final electron acceptor. The preferential use of other inorganic electron acceptors depends on the redox potential. The electron acceptor with the highest redox potential is used first, which is generally oxygen, then nitrate, metals, sulphate and carbon dioxide (see fig. 3). 

Fig. 3. Microbial decomposition of organic compounds and the preferentially used electron accepting process according to the actual redox potential. 

However, such electron acceptors as nitrate, metals, sulphate or carbon dioxide can not act as a cosubstrate for the initial reactions. Another mechanism is probably involved to establish breakdown of the aromatic ring under anoxic conditions. Vogel and GrbÌc-GalÌc [1986] showed that under methanogenic conditions, activation of the aromatic ring involves the addition of an oxygen atom derived from water to the ring. 

Since hydrocarbons entering the environment will move through the soil and/or the groundwater where the level of dissolved oxygen decreases, resulting in decreasing redox potentials, natural aerobic biodegradation of the hydrocarbons will be limited. Therefore, mineralization of (halo)aromatics in such environments will not only depend on the availability of oxygen, but also on the availability of alternative electron acceptors. There are a few recent reports describing the oxidation of (halo)aromatic compounds in the presence of alternative electron acceptors. 

2.5.1 _Biodegradation of (halo)aromatics under denitrifying conditions_ Dolfing et al. [1990] isolated and characterized a _Pseudomonas_ sp. that mineralizes toluene in the absence of molecular oxygen. The organism mineralizes toluene and _m_ -xylene in pure culture, and nitrate served as the electron acceptor and was reduced to nitrite. Nitrite was reduced further only after nitrate depletion. Conversion of 1 mM toluene resulted in production of about 


3 mM nitrite, which appeared growth inhibitory. When nitrous oxide served as the electron acceptor, this inhibitory effect could be avoided and therefore a higher cell yield was obtained. However, in FeS reduced medium, toluene degradation coupled to the reduction of nitrous oxide was severely inhibited. Sulphide probably inhibits the nitrous oxide reductase. This problem was not seen when nitrate was supplied as the primary electron acceptor. The authors do not speculate about the pathway used for the anaerobic degradation of toluene. Coschigano et al. [1994] reported on the metabolism of 4-chlorobenzoate and toluene by a constructed bacterial strain. This bacterium obtained the ability to convert 4-chlorobenzoate hydrolytically to 4-hydroxybenzoate. The latter could be degraded with nitrate as an electron acceptor. Nitrate was reduced to nitrite and finally to nitrogen gas. Probably, Coenzyme A thioesters are intermediates in the degradation pathway. These thioesters are formed due to the action of benzoylCoA-ligase. The constructed bacterial strain could also degrade a mixture of 4-chlorobenzoate and toluene under denitrifying conditions. However, toluene was metabolized by the transconjugant at an initial rate of 95 _μ_ mol⋅l-1⋅h-1^ if provided as the sole substrate. The initial degradation rate decreased dramatically to 15 _μ_ mol⋅l-1⋅h-1^ when 4-chlorobenzoate was also present at a concentration of 300 _μ_ M. The initial rate of 4-chlorobenzoate degradation was 57 _μ_ mol⋅l-1⋅h-1, which decreased to 29 _μ_ mol⋅l-1⋅h-1^ in the presence of toluene. Su and Kafkewitz [1994] described a _Pseudomonas maltophilia_ species able to utilize toluene and xylenes under low oxygen and anoxic conditions in the presence of nitrate. In the presence of low oxygen concentrations (2 %) and nitrate better growth was observed than in the presence of nitrate alone. Nitrate was completely reduced to nitrogen gas. The presence of benzene (100 _μ_ M) did not affect the extent of the degradation of toluene (500 _μ_ M). The presence of low amounts of oxygen in combination with nitrate seems to be beneficial for the degradation, possibly because the presence of oxygen increases the cell numbers. Biegert and Fuchs [1995] reported the anaerobic oxidation of toluene to benzoate by a denitrifying _Thauera_ species. The bacterium used nitrate as electron acceptor. Nitrate was first completely reduced to nitrite before nitrite was reduced to N 2 O and dinitrogen during growth on toluene. Cell suspensions of anaerobically toluene grown cells degraded 4-, 3-, and 2-fluorotoluene, 4-, 3-, and 2-chlorotoluene, _p-_ cresol, _p-, m-,_ and _o-_ xylene and _p-, m-,_ and _o_ -methylbenzoic acid with nitrate as electron acceptor to their benzoate analogues. The oxidation of the methyl group of toluene was coupled to the reduction of nitrate, and was inhibited by the presence of oxygen. 

The benzoate formed is probably further metabolized via benzoylCoA. Jorgensen et al. [1995] investigated the stoichiometry and kinetics of microbial degradation of toluene under denitrifying conditions by bacterial communities derived from a mixture of sludges from sewage treatment plants. The culture was able to degrade toluene in the presence of nitrate, nitrite, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide or oxygen. The degradation rate of toluene obtained under denitrifying conditions was approximately the same as under oxic conditions. The rates of nitrate and nitrite consumption were proportional to the rate of toluene degradation. The maximum specific rate of degradation was estimated to be 0.71 mg toluene per mg protein per hour, and the yield coefficient was estimated to be 0.14 mg protein per mg toluene. Maximum specific growth rates of 0.10 h-1^ were acheived. Rabus and Widdel [1995] reported on the anaerobic degradation of ethylbenzene and other related aromatic compounds by new denitrifying bacteria, related to _Thauera selenatis_. One of the isolates, strain EbN1, degraded ethylbenzene with stoichiometric reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas, see equation below: 

### C 8 H 10 + 8.4NO 3 -^ + 0.4H+^ → 8HCO 3 -^ + 4.2N 2 + 1.2H 2 O 

No growth under oxic conditions could be obtained on ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, toluene and _m_ -xylene, either in the presence or absence of nitrate. However, most of the polar aromatic substrates, such as benzoate and phenylacetate, on which anaerobic growth was obtained could also be degraded under oxic conditions. The mechanism of the initial reaction during aromatic 


hydrocarbon degradation in the absence of oxygen remains unclear. Olsen et al. [1994] and Kukor and Olsen [1996] studied the biodegradation of toluene by some _Pseudomonas_ sp. under both low (2 %) and high (air saturation) oxygen concentrations. Three pseudomonads showed enhanced nitrate dependent growth on toluene under oxygen-limiting conditions. These pseudomonads ( _Pseudomonas_ sp. strain PKO1, _Pseudomonas_ sp. strain W31 and _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ CFS215) were isolated from hypoxic (i.e. O 2 -limiting) petroleum contaminated aquifers and were compared with pseudomonads originating from non-hypoxic aerobic environments that did not show enhanced nitrate dependent growth on toluene under hypoxic conditions. The toluene degradation rate was significantly enhanced by the presence of nitrate for strains PKO1, W31 and CSF215. These strains seemed to have a catechol-2,3-dioxygenase with higher affinities than those strains that could not grow with low oxygen concentrations.This suggests that a group of micro-organisms has evolved which is for the most part indistuinguishable from closely related species, but which has adapted to growth and metabolism in low oxygen environments. Such organisms may facilitate the _in situ_ bioremediation of xenobiotics because often low oxygen concentrations and nitrate are present in soils and/or groundwater. 

2.5.2 _Biodegradation of (halo)aromatics under metal reducing conditions_ Anaerobic degradation of monoaromatic compounds with iron(III) as the sole electron acceptor by _Geobacter metallireducens_ was shown by Lovley et al. [1993]. 

Under iron reducing conditions toluene, benzoate, benzaldehyde, benzylalcohol, _p_ -hydroxybenzoate, _p_ -hydroxybenzaldehyde, _p_ -hydroxybenzylalcohol, phenol and _p_ -cresol were utilized by this organism. Kazumi et al. [1995] demonstrated the degradation of monochlorinated and nonchlorinated aromatic compounds under iron reducing conditions in anoxic sediment enrichments. Benzoate, phenol and 2-,3-, and 4-chlorophenol degradation coupled to stoichiometric reduction of Fe3+^ to Fe2+^ could be obtained and maintained after refeeding of the sediment enrichments. Anaerobic degradation of 3-chlorobenzoate and aniline was initially observed but could not be maintained after refeeding of the enrichments. The stoichiometry of the anaerobic degradation of phenol and chlorophenol are shown in the equations below: 

phenol: 

 C 6 H 6 O + 28Fe3+^ + 17H 2 O → 6HCO 3 -^ + 28Fe2+^ + 34H + 

chlorophenol: 

 C 6 H 5 OCl + 27Fe3+^ + 17H 2 O → 6HCO 3 -^ + 27Fe2+^ + 33H+^ + Cl

Coates et al. [1996] isolated five organisms from freshwater aquatic sediments, a pristine deep aquifer, and a petroleum-contaminated shallow aquifer, which could obtain energy for growth by dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction. All the isolates belong to the genus _Geobacter_. Three of the five isolates could use hydrogen gas and benzoate as electron donors for Fe(III) reduction. One strain could use toluene as electron donor in the presence of soluble Fe(III) as electron acceptor. Rapid anaerobic benzene oxidation with a variety of chelated Fe(III) forms was demonstrated by Lovely et al. [1996]. Fe(III) chelated to compounds like EDTA, _N_ -methyliminodiacetic acid, ethanol diglycine, humic acids and phosphates stimulated benzene oxidation coupled to Fe(III) reduction in anaerobic sediments from a petroleum-contaminated aquifer. So, many forms of chelated Fe(III) might be essential for remediation of aquifers. In microcosms and enrichments Shen et al. [1996] achieved bacterial degradation of benzoate with the transport of electrons to Cr(IV). 


Nitrate or oxygen were used as initial stimulators, and after depletion of oxygen or nitrate microcosms and enrichments still retained the capacity of benzoate oxidation linked to Cr(IV) reduction to Cr(III). Benzoate degradation was strongly dependent on the presence of Cr(IV). The addition of nitrate up to a concentration of 5.0 mM did not inhibit Cr(IV) reduction but enhanced benzoate degradation in the enrichments. 

2.5.3 _Bacterial oxidation of aromatics coupled to sulphate reduction_ Haag et al. [1991] reported on the degradation of toluene and _p_ -xylene in anaerobic microcosms. They found evidence for sulphate acting as a terminal electron acceptor. Complete degradation of toluene and xylene by aquifer micro-organisms coupled to the reduction of sulphate was also shown by Edwards et al. [1992]. 

Toluene and _o-, m-,_ and _p_ -xylene were completely mineralized to CO 2 and biomass under strictly anoxic sulphate reducing conditions. The doubling time of the culture was approximately 20 days and the cell yield 0.1 to 0.14 g of cells (dry weight) per g of substrate. Sulphide production as a result of sulphate reduction was inhibitory for the degradation of the aromatic hydrocarbons. Beller et al. [1992] investigated microbial degradation of toluene under sulphate reducing conditions in anaerobic microcosms and the influence of iron on the biodegradative process. Addition of amorphic iron (Fe(OH) 3 ) to microcosms and enrichment cultures either greatly facilitated the onset of toluene degradation or accelerated the rate once degradation had begun. In microcosms and enrichments amended with iron, the reduction of ferric iron to ferro iron proceeded concurrently with toluene degradation and sulphate reduction. Probably abiotic reduction of iron with hydrogen sulphide originating from sulphate reduction occurred. Rabus et al. [1993] isolated a bacterium from marine sediment, strain Tol2, under strictly anoxic conditions. The organism degrades toluene under sulphate reducing conditions and seems to belong to the genus _Desulfobacterium_. Toluene concentrations exceeding 0.5 mM were toxic for the bacterium. Doubling times of 72 hours could be achieved. Lovley et al. [1995] showed benzene degradation coupled to the reduction of sulphate. With tracer element studies they demonstrated that [^14 C]benzene was for 92 % degraded to 14 CO 2. Sulphate was depleted from the medium during benzene metabolism. Benzene degradation immediately stopped when when sediments became sulphate limiting and benzene uptake resumed when sulphate was added again. Molybdate, an inhibitor of sulphate reduction resulted in ceased benzene degradation. The stoichiometry of benzene metabolism coupled to the reduction of sulphate is shown in the equation below: 

### 4C 6 H 6 + 15SO 4 2-^ + 12H 2 O → 24HCO 3 -^ + 15HS-^ + 9H+ 

2.6 **Bacterial oxidation of (halo)aromatics under methanogenic conditions** 

GrbÌc-GalÌc and Vogel [1987] were the first to report on the anaerobic degradation of benzene under methanogenic conditions. At least 50 % of the carbon of both toluene and benzene were degraded to CO 2 and methane. Detection of intermediates revealed that both benzene and toluene were initially oxidized by ring-hydroxylation (benzene) or methyl oxidation (toluene). Based on other detectable intermediates a degradation pathway is proposed for the degradation of toluene and benzene. The tentative sequences of anaerobic methanogenic toluene and benzene degradation to methane and carbon dioxide is shown in figure 4. 


Fig. 4. Tentative sequences of anaerobic toluene and benzene degradation by mixed methanogenic cultures [GrbÌc-GalÌc and Vogel, 1987]. 

Anaerobic degradation of toluene and _o_ -xylene by a methanogenic consortium, derived from an aquifer contaminated with creosote and pentachlorophenol was shown by Edwards and GrbÌcGalÌc [1994]. Toluene and _o_ -xylene were completely mineralized to CO 2 , CH 4 and biomass after very long lag periods (100 120 days for toluene degradation, 200 255 days for _o_ -xylene degradation). Growth inhibitory concentrations were 700 _μ_ M for xylene and 1,800 _μ_ M for toluene. Alternate electron acceptors, such as oxygen, nitrate and sulphate, inhibited the degradation. The same was true when additional preferred substrates were present (acetate, hydrogen, propionate, methanol, acetone, glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, peptone and yeast extract). This suggests that the presence of natural organic substrates or co-contaminants may inhibit anaerobic degradation of pollutants such as toluene and _o_ -xylene at contaminated sites. Chaudri and Wiesmann [1995] detected benzoate as an intermediate in anaerobic enrichment cultures during anaerobic benzene degradation. Although methane was produced, it was doubted whether the methanogens themselves degraded the benzene. When micro-aerobic conditions were established in the enrichment, the growth and benzene degradation rates were noticed to increase only slightly but the production of methane reduced.

2.7 **Biological treatment of monochlorobenzenes** 

There are only a few known examples of bioremediation of monochlorobenzene contaminations at this moment. The biological treatment of waste gas contaminated with monochlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene was shown by Oh and Bartha [1994]. A maximum removal rate of 200 g/m^3 /h of these chlorobenzenes (1.8 g/m^3 ) was obtained by leading the gas stream via a biological trickling filter (1.6 l) which was inoculated with a bacterial culture (mainly _Pseudomonas_ sp.). The air velocity was 102 m/h and the flow of the liquid phase was 3.2 l/h. In soil contaminated with monochlorobenzene and 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene degradation by indigenous microbes was obtained by using biostimulation and aeration [Peck et al., 1995]. From laboratory experiments it was concluded that the indigenous microbes were able to degrade the contaminants. Low levels of organic material (straw) and nutrients were added to the soil to stimulate the indigenous population to degrade the chlorobenzenes. Within a period of 5 weeks more than 90 % of the chlorobenzenes (1 6 mg/kg) was degraded. Folsom et al. [1995] reported on the remediation of groundwater contaminated with a mixture of pollutants. One of the main contaminants, 1,2-dichlorobenzene and some other dichlorobenzenes (0.1 2 mg/l), were degraded for more than 92 % in a fluidized-bed bioreactor (250 l). The flow rate of the reactor was 7.6 l/min (hydraulic retention time of 30 minutes). 

2.8 **Concluding remarks** 

Biodegradation of chlorobenzenes under both oxic and anoxic conditions was shown by many researchers. Under anoxic conditions, chlorinated benzenes serve as electron acceptors: chlorine substituents are replaced by hydrogen atoms. Higher halogenated benzenes are more easily reduced than lower halogenated benzenes. Under oxic conditions many bacteria are able to mineralize chlorinated benzenes to CO 2 and cell carbon. Lower halogenated benzenes are more easily degraded than higher halogenated benzenes under oxic conditions. 

Biological treatment of chlorobenzenes contaminated waste has been shown in waste gas, soil, and groundwater. 

Aniline can be mineralized both under oxic and anoxic conditions and can serve as carbon-, energy-, and nitrogen source. However, under anoxic conditions very long lag-periods (6 18 months) were observed. 

Mixtures of aromatic xenobiotic compounds can have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on their biodegradation. Metabolic pathways can be inhibited and misrouting of substrates may lead to toxic (suicidal) products. On the other hand additional substrates may enhance biodegradation of primary substrates by improved induction of particular pathways. 

Degradation of (halo)aromatic compounds under denitrifying, metal reducing, sulphidogenic and methanogenic conditions has been shown in pure culture-, mixed cultureand microcosm studies. 


### CHAPTER 3 

## PRACTICAL APPROACH 

The biodegradative capacities of the indigenous microbes will be studied. Therefore the presence of viable microbes at the contaminated site which are capable of degrading monochlorobenzene and to a lesser extent aniline will be shown first. Next, the optimum physicochemical conditions for the biodegradation of monochlorobenzene and aniline will be determined. Experiments will be done in soil slurries, batch enrichments, and bioreactors. Field measurements at the contaminated site revealed that monochlorobenzene and aniline are indeed the main contaminants, although high concentrations of di-aminodiphenylmethane were also observed. Therefore the main focus will be on the kinetics of monochlorobenzene degradation and the influence of aniline on this degradation process. Once good degradation is obtained in soil slurries and soil columns, the influence of diaminophenylmethane could be tested additionally. At some sampling sites the pH seemed to be very high (≈ 13), but the general picture is that the pH value lies between 7 and 9. 

3.1 **Activity of indigenous microbes** 

Viable monochlorobenzene and aniline degrading microbes must be present at the contaminated site to establish _in situ_ bioremediation. 

Soil samples with groundwater (1 : 1) of the various contaminated layers (top sandy layer (0 5 m depth), clay (5 15 m depth), and the deeper sand layer (15 23 m depth)) will be incubated at both the _in situ_ temperature (≈ 12 °C) and 30 °C without additional nutrients and substrates (monochlorobenzene and aniline). Decrease of the _in situ_ concentrations of monochlorobenzene and aniline and the production of carbon dioxide will be monitored in time. 

3.2 **Batch incubations (soil slurries)** 

The influence of environmental factors on the degradation rates of monochlorobenzene and aniline in a semi-natural system (presence of heterogenic soil or sediment) can be studied in these batch slurry incubations. 

Soil samples will be suspended in groundwater (1 : 1) and additions of substrates, electron acceptors and nutrients can be made in these soil slurries. The degradation rate of monochlorobenzene will be monitored under oxic conditions. 

To determine the toxicity of monochlorobenzene, incubations will be done with increasing monochlorobenzene concentrations. 

If there are inhibitory or stimulatory effects of the additional contaminant aniline on the degradation rate of monochlorobenzene, incubations with monochlorobenzene as a substrate in the presence of increasing concentrations aniline (range 0 10 mM) will be carried out. To see whether additional carbon sources and nutrients will enhance the degradation rate, the decrease of monochlorobenzene in soil slurries will be followed in the presence of different amounts of yeast extract and nutrients The degradation of monochlorobenzene under anoxic conditions in the presence of alternative electron acceptors will also be studied, since oxidation of (halo)aromatics under such conditions has been shown previously. Whether there are microbes present capable of dechlorination of monochlorobenzene to benzene will also be tested in anoxic incubations in the presence of mixtures of electron donors. The main parameters to be tested are listed in table 7.

3.3 **Soil column experiments** 

In soil columns the natural habitat of the indigenous micro-organisms can be maintained by packing the columns with undisturbed soil samples of the contaminated site. The response of varying environmental conditions on the degradation kinetics of monochlorobenzene in such a system will be closely related to the natural situation. 

The most favourable conditions for biodegradation of monochlorobenzene obtained in batchslurry experiments will be applied to these soil columns. A flow through of groundwater with particular additions can be established and the degradation of the contaminants will be monitored in time. 

3.4 **Batch enrichment studies** 

Oxygen plays a dual role in the degradation of aromatic compounds. Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor, but it is also a cosubstrate in initial reactions catalysed by enzymes like dioxygenases or mono-oxygenases which incorporate molecular oxygen into the aromatic ring. However, in soils and sediments the oxygen concentration is often low. Therefore, mineralization of (halo)aromatics may depend on the presence of alternative electron acceptors or combinations of various electron acceptors. 

In soil slurries it is **not possible** to study the influence of low oxygen concentrations on the degradation rates of monochlorobenzene, because of the heterogeneity caused by the presence of sediment. The influence of low oxygen concentrations on the degradation rate can be studied in batch enrichments, in which microbial consortia can be studied in homogenous cultures without any sediment. 

The degradation rate of monochlorobenzene will be determined in the presence of oxygen varying from 1 to 20 % O 2. Under low oxygen conditions also the influence of nitrate will be determined, since there are a few examples in the literature in which enhanced degradation of aromatics was shown with oxygen plus nitrate as electron acceptors (see table 8). 


Table 8. The influence of various oxygen concentrations in the absence and presence of nitrate on the degradation rate of monochlorobenzene that will be tested in batch enrichment studies. MCB + 1 % O 2 * MCB + 2 % O 2 MCB + 5 % O 2 MCB + 10 % O 2 

MCB + 20 % O (^2) + or nitrate + or nitrate + or nitrate + or nitrate + or nitrate * 1 % O 2 in the gas phase, represents 0.9 mM O 2 available for monochlorobenzene degradation in the liquid phase (liquid = 100 ml, gas phase = 210 ml). 3.5 **Continuous culture experiments** In continuous cultures the environmental conditions can be manipulated most effectively. Therefore the influence of pH, temperature, substrate concentrations, additional substrates, oxygen supply, and additional electron acceptors on the degradation of monochlorobenzene can be investigated with high accuracy. Moreover, the influence of **very low** oxygen concentrations can hardly be examined in **batch enrichment** studies. In addition, studies in chemostats will be a useful tool to investigate the effect of oxygen-limitation on the biodegradative capacities of microbial consortia. Also the effects of combinations of various environmental conditions (low O 2 + different pH, various temperatures, additional carbon sources, etc.) on the degradation rates can be studied in continuous culture experiments. 3.6 **Isolations and characterizations** It is obvious from literature that when it is known which organisms do degrade the contaminants and which pathways are most important for the metabolism of the substrates, predictions can be made about which factors are important to establish good degradation. Therefore isolations will be done from the contaminated site. At first dilution series have to be made. From these dilution series the most abundant monochlorobenzene degrading organism(s) will be isolated and characterized. Effects of environmental conditions on the degradation kinetics of these monochlorobenzene degrading bacteria can be studied in detail. Whether attempts will be made to isolate monochlorobenzene or aniline oxidizing organisms under anoxic conditions will depend on the success of the anoxic incubations of the soil slurry experiments. 3.7 **Inocula** For the laboratory experiments soil samples of the various contaminated layers (top sandy layer (0 5 m depth), clay (5 15 m depth), and the deeper sand layer (15 23 m depth)) will be used as inocula. In addition, biosludge from an activated sludge water treatment plant will be used. The influent of the activated sludge water treatment plant contains aniline and monochlorobenzene, so the biosludge is adapted to these substrates. Therefore, long lag periods can be avoided. 



### CHAPTER 4 

## RESULTS 

4.1 **Activity of indigenous microbes** 

In soil slurry experiments it was proven that there is activity of indigenous microbes, responsible for the degradation of monochlorobenzene under aerobic conditions. A decrease in monochlorobenzene concentration, consumption of oxygen and production of CO 2 could be measured. 

Soil samples from filters at the MDI location, filters 601, 602 and 603, were incubated under aerobic conditions (20 % oxygen) in the presence of 0.5 mM monochlorobenzene ( _in situ_ concentration) (T = 30 °C). Disappearance of monochlorobenzene was followed in time (see table 9 and plotted in fig. 5 (filter 603)).

Degradation of monochlorobenzene started after one month of incubation. Once degradation started, monochlorobenzene degradation rates between 155 and 207 _μ_ mol per kilogram soil per day were established. After approximately two months all the monochlorobenzene was disappeared in the soil slurry from filter 603. Soil slurries from filters 601 and 602 needed three months for complete monochlorobenzene degradation, including the lag-period (adaptation period micro-organisms need to start degradation, see fig. 5). 

Fig. 5. Degradation of chlorobenzene in a soil slurry at 30 °C (20 % oxygen). 


4.2 **Toxicity of monochlorobenzene and aniline to monochlorobenzene and aniline degrading bacteria** 

Incubations in batch slurries inoculated with sludge originating from the waste water treatment system with various concentrations monochlorobenzene or aniline, revealed that biodegradation takes place up to 10 mM monochlorobenzene or aniline, added as sole C/E source. 

So, based on these results, no toxicity problems of the primary contaminants are to be expected to play a role. However, the lag-phase before growth occurred increased with increasing substrate concentrations. 

In addition, degradation rates of monochlorobenzene may be influenced positively or negatively by the presence of the co-contaminant aniline (see 4.4). 

4.3 **Effect of additional carbon sources and nutrients on monochlorobenzene degradation** 

In batch slurries, inoculated with soil (filters 601, 602, 603), incubated at 30 °C with 2 mM monochlorobenzene showed degradation rates between 155 and 207 _μ_ moles/kg per day (see 4.1). Additions of 0.5 g/l yeast extract (a complex mixture of organic nutrients) or vitamins did not enhance the degradation rate of monochlorobenzene. More carbon dioxide was produced and higher concentrations of oxygen were consumed, both due to biodegradation of organic carbon present in yeast extract. 

4.4 **Effect of the co-contaminant on monochlorobenzene degradation** 

The effect of the co-contaminant aniline on the monochlorobenzene degradation was tested in enrichments from both soil and sludge at 30 °C. The initial MCB concentration in these slurries was 1 mM, whereas the initial aniline concentration varied from 0 to 2 mM. 

4.4.1 _Effects of aniline on monochlorobenzene degradation in batch-soil enrichments_ The influence of the co-contaminant aniline on the degradation kinetics of monochlorobenzene in soil was tested in batch enrichments. The enrichments were made from soil slurries originating from filters 601, 602, and 603. After vigorous shaking of a soil-slurry, made from soil and groundwater (1 : 1), and sedimentation of soil particles, the above liquid was filtered through a 5 _μ_ m filter to get rid of protozoa. The filtrate was used as inoculum for batch enrichments, which contained synthetic growth medium with 1 mM monochlorobenzene as the growth substrate. After MCB degradation was complete, the culture was transferred and subdivided into fresh media with 2 mM monochlorobenzene and either 0, 0.5, 1 or 2 mM aniline. With increasing concentrations of aniline decreasing degradation rates of monochlorobenzene were measured, from 624 _μ_ mol⋅h-1⋅g protein-1^ in cultures with only monochlorobenzene as growth substrate to 92 _μ_ mol⋅h-1⋅g protein-1^ if 2 mM aniline was present (see table 10 and fig. 6A-D). These cultures were all incubated aerobically (air saturating conditions), at 30 °C, in the dark.

4.4.2 _Effect of aniline on monochlorobenzene degradation in batch-sludge enrichments_ The influence of the co-contaminant aniline on the degradation kinetics of monochlorobenzene in sludge was tested both in batch slurries and batch enrichments. The effect of additional aniline is not significant in slurries made from sludge: neither a positive effect nor a negative effect was observed. However, in sludge enrichement cultures (after 5 transfers), a strong negative influence on the specific rate of monochlorobenzene degradation was observed. This decreased from 595 to 21 _μ_ mol⋅h-1⋅g protein-1^ with increasing aniline concentrations (see table 11 en fig. 7A-H). Yet, significant variation in the outcome of these experiments was noted.

In the very first enrichment transfer from active sludge a positive effect of aniline on the monochlorobenzene degradation rate was observed (data not shown). Upon further transfer of this enrichment into the fresh media, with various concentrations of aniline, the results were obtained as shown in table 11. This effect may be explained by substantial changes in the composition of the selection of microbial species which outcompeted the initial population with respect to monochlorobenzene degradation but were more sensitive to aniline. 

4.5 **Monochlorobenzene degradation in soil-, and sludge slurries incubated under anaerobic conditions** 

In batch slurries, both from soil (filter 801 and 802, 16 17 m depth) and sludge, the capacity of the indigenous microbes to degrade monochlorobenzene under anaerobic conditions was tested. Alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate, iron(III) and sulphate, were added to these slurries. In none of theses slurries monochlorobenzene degradation occurred within 7 months. If monochlorobenzene itself was supplied as electron acceptor in combination with a range of electron donors, such as lactate, formate and acetate, no disappearance of monochlorobenzene 


could be detected. So, under these anaerobic conditions no degradation of monochlorobenzene could be detected (see table 12).

In batch experiments the degradation rate of monochlorobenzene at varying oxygen concentrations was determined at 30 °C, both for enrichments from activated sludge and soil samples, and at the _in situ_ temperature for sludge enrichments (12 °C). 

4.6.1 _Degradation kinetics of monochlorobenzene at 30_ ° _C_ In soil enrichments with low oxygen concentrations, 2 % and 0,5 % O 2 respectively, no chloride was formed, due to incomplete monochlorobenzene degradation. Probably accumulation of chlorocatechols occurred, since the media turned brownish. The specific monochlorobenzene degradation rates decreased with decreasing oxygen concentrations (see table 13). In figure 8A, B, C and D the results of the complete (A + B) and incomplete (C + D) degradation in soil enrichments of monochlorobenzene are shown. 

Monochlorobenzene degradation in enrichments of activated sludge showed the same pattern as soil enrichments, that is decreasing monochlorobenzene degradation rates with decreasing oxygen concentrations. However, the monochlorobenzene degradation at low oxygen concentrations was complete. Both total disappearance of monochlorobenzene and full chloride recovery could be measured (see table 13).

4.6.2 _Degradation kinetics of monochlorobenzene at 12_ ° _C_ Sludgeand soil enrichments were also incubated with monochlorobenzene at various oxygen concentrations at the _in situ_ temperature (12 °C). The MCB degradation rate in sludge enrichments (12 °C) was significantly lower than the degradation rate achieved at 30 °C. At high oxygen concentrations the degradation rate was also higher than at low oxygen concentrations, a comparable tendency was found at 30 °C. 

In batch-soil enrichments complete degradation occurred at high oxygen concentrations. No degradation was observed within 2 months under reduced partial pressures of oxygen (see table 14 and fig. 8A and B). 

At higher oxygen concentrations a higher MCB degradation rate was observed, both at 30 °C and 12 °C.

4.7 **Effect of additional alternative electron acceptors on monochlorobenzen degradation at low oxygen concentrations** 

The effect of additional alternative electron acceptors on the monochlorobenzene degradation at low oxygen concentrations (3 % O 2 ) at 30 °C and 12 °C was studied in both soiland sludge enrichments. 

In sludge enrichments a slight decrease in the initial nitrate concentration (from 10 to 7 mM) was observed. The sludge enrichments in which sulphate was added no decrease of sulphate was observed. In soil enrichments a comparable effect was shown for incubations with nitrate as additional electron acceptor. Since no brownish colour appeared in the medium during incubations in both soiland sludge enrichments probably no catechol was produced as an intermediate. 

The MCB degradation rates in both sludgeand soil enrichments are presented in table 15 and figures 10A, B, C and D (sludge), and figure 11. Table 15.

4.8 **Monochlorobenzene degradation in soil columns** 

_Procedure_ The soil columns were packed with 1 kg of a mixture of soil originating from filters 601, 602, 603, 801 and 802.The column is recirculated (flow rate is 540 ml/hr) with 230 ml ground water (see fig. 12). A monochlorobenzene concentration of 1.0 mM and 10 mM nitrate is injected into the bottle. To establish saturation of monochlorobenzene attached to the soil particles, the columns were respiked several times with 1.0 mM MCB to a final nominal concentration equivalent to 23 mM in the water phase and 0.6 mg per kg of soil. As soon as a stable level in the water phase of MCB was established (about 10 _μ_ M) the column was fed with peroxide (0.1 mM/day), to create an aerobic environment. 

_Results_ After 150 days of recirculation of the water phase, only between 0.16 and 0.24 mg MCB/kg soil (comparable with 6 9 mM in the water phase) remained in both the aerobic and anaerobic soil column according to GC-MS measurements (mean values). High concentrations of chloride could also be detected at the end of incubation. Therefore degradation of MCB occurred both under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. In the anaerobic column, no benzene could be detected as a product of anaerobic dehalorespiration (see table 16). 

The observation of CB disappearance in the anoxic column is unexpected if compared with the negative results obtained with anoxic batch incubations (see table 12). Both oxygen and redox analysis of the circulating medium confirmed that the conditions in the column were strictly anoxic. The incomplete recovery of the chlorine could indicate the accumulation of undegraded chlorine containing intermediates not detected in the GC-analysis employed in this study. Yet, in spite of these incomplete balances we may conclude that monochlorobenzene is not only degraded under oxic conditions. It can only be speculated that that presence of soil structures and surfaces may explain the observed degradation in soil columns and the absence of breakdown in batch cultures.

4.9 **Monochlorobenzene degradation in continuous culture** 

A continuous culture was set up as a tool to study the effects of environmental conditions in an accurate way on the MCB degradation kinetics. 

A continuous culture was started (dilution rate 0.01 h-1, pH 7 7.3, _Sr_ chlorobenzene 1 mM, _Sr_ nitrate 10 mM, 1% O 2 ) with an inoculum from a soil slurry. The incubation temperature was 12 °C. No degradation of monochlorobenzene could be detected during one month. After reinoculation with activated sludge material, good MCB degradation was observed. However, as soon as the bioreactor became limited for several days, monochlorobenzene degradation ceased. The same phenomenon was observed at a temperature of 30 °C. So, no continuous enrichment culture could be obtained. 


Toxic products accumulating during MCB limited growth can be ruled out since stable MCB degrading enrichments were able to grow in the supernatant of the chemostat culture. 

Wash out of growth factors present in the inoculum (activated sludge) or disturbance of formed bacterial aggregates by stirring may be responsible for the interrupted MCB degradation. 


### CHAPTER 5 

## CONCLUSIONS 

Degradation of monochlorobenzene occurred both in soiland sludge slurries and in enrichments. 

Incomplete degradation of monochlorobenzene was observed under conditions with restricted oxygen availability. In soil enrichments chlorocatechols accumulated during MCB degradation under low oxygen concentrations. This same effect was not observed during MCB degradation at low oxygen concentration in sludge enrichments. 

Decreasing MCB degradation rates were found with decreasing oxygen concentrations for both soil-, and sludge enrichments 

Additional alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulphate did not enhance the monochlorobenzene degradation rate of low partial pressure of oxygen, despite the fact that some nitrate was reduced. 

The effect of the co-contaminant aniline appears to be somewhat unpredictable: initial stimulatory effects were no longer observed upon further transfers. Instead, decreased rates of degradation were observed, possibly due to changes in community composition. 

Degradation of monochlorobenzene in sludge slurries occurred at 30 °C and at the _in situ_ tem

perature (12 °C) in the presence of low oxygen concentrations. 

No MCB degradation was observed under denitrifying, iron reducing, sulphate reducing and dehalorespiring conditions in batch slurries and enrichments but in anoxic soil columns indications for breakdown of monochlorobenzene have been obtained.
