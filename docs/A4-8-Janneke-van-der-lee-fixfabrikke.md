Fixfabriken | Göteborg | Sweden 

The project area is situated in Göteborg, the second largest 

city in Sweden. 

The Fixfabriken area is located south of the river Göta Alv, 

near the The Älvsborg Bridge, four kilometres from the city 

centre of Göteborg. 

The Fixfabriken area is surrounded by different 

neighborhoods and by a highway (E45) in the north.

### soil types 

The soil types are related to the differences 

in height in the area. On the highest points 

you can find most of the time rock.

### contamination 

From ‘ _FIXFABRIKEN AREA. Notes regard-_ 

_ing archaeological and soil conditions as-_ 

_pects_ ’ by Chalmers students: 

At the Fixfabriken factory, several products 

have been manufactured over the years, 

e.g. fittings for doors and windows. In the 

factory there are both workshop and sur

face treatment works (Carlsson, 2014). 

The bus garage was constructed in the late 

70s and includes several on-site activities 

that are likely to cause soil contamination. 

There are or have been e.g. garages, car 

washes, truck service, temporary boiler 

house. 

The existing tram hall was built in the 40s 

and entails risk of contamination due to the 

present and past activities e.g.: garages 

and workshops, boilers systems, laundry 

and electric transformers (Carlsson, 2014). 

Along the street Karl Johansgatan which 

forms the northeast boundary of the area, 

and in the neighbouring areas, several ac

tivities have been conducted that can pose 

risks of soil contamination: petrol stations, 

cleaning operations, warehouses, a former 

bus garage and traffic.

# theoretical framework 

## Fixfabriken | Göteborg 


16 

### theory 

The scheme of Saskia Sassen pointed out 

the interconnectivity between large and 

small scales and the flows of the city. This 

is an interesting starting point to look at the 

city and the area. 

Because this project is situated in Swe

den this project is also framed by an ar

ticle about ecosystem services. ‘Ecosys

tem services’ refers to the benefits human 

populations derive from ecosystems. They 

conclude that the locally generated eco

system services, like air filtration and cul

tural values, have a substantial impact on 

the quality-of-life in urban areas and should 

be addressed in land-use planning. 

The Nested Scales of Urban Impacts on the Biosphere: 

the interconnectivity of the world from the largest scale to the scale of the individual (Sassen, 2012) 

Boland and Hunhammar, Ecosystem services in urban areas (1999)

### Hammerby 

This model is used for the Hammerby proj

ect in Stockholm, a environmental redevel

opment project of a former industrial and 

harbour area. This project is a showcase 

for sustainable development in Sweden. 

They approach this project with an inte

gral energy, waste and water system. An 

important recommandation: ‘a new centre 

for environmental information and commu

nication should be established in new dis

tricts, with the view to support a systematic 

marketing of knowledge of system technol

ogy, environmental technology and urban 

district planning. The centre should also in

form and support the residents influencing 

their environmental behaviour.’

### design 

The ‘uppleva Fixfabriken!’ project is divided in four phases be

cause of the subsoil contamination and the existing contracts with 

landowners. In the beginning of the development the people are 

made aware of the future developments on the Fixfabriken site. A 

square in front of the tramhall, new functions in the tramhall (an in

formation center, a hotel and cultural functions) and a watchtower 

are therefor the fi rst interventions. The tram line will be extended 

to the south and there will be started with the green buffer boule

vard along the highway. On the crossing of most of the cables and 

pipes (near the existing park) there will be build a biogas plant and 

cogeneration system for energy and biogas for cars and buses. 

To start quickly with the development of dwellings on the Fixfab

riken area, this site will be remediate by electro reclamation in 2-4 

years. Also the tram hall site will be remediated in this way. After 

2-5 years the Fixfabriken dwellings can be build. The urban fabric 

is designed taking into account the most effi cient way of cables 

and pipes for the entire area. In this phase the development of the 

cleaning park (gentle remediation of the busgarage) can start. In 

this cleaning park people can experience the helophyte fi lter and 

the gentle remediation process by elevated paths. In the east ele

vated small offi ces can be developed, because living is restricted 

above gentle remediation. Because of the helophyte fi lter a seper

ate sewer system will be implemented. Another 5 years later the 

dwellings in the backside of the Vagnhallen (tram hall) can be build 

and the upplevelse route (experience route) along all interesting 

points in the area can be created. This upplevelse route start at the 

Vagnhallen, where there is an information center and where peo

ple can have a view from the watchtower. Along the route there are 

red arches on interesting points (archeology, biogas and cogenar

tion system, helophyte fi lter etc.) where people can get information 

by using their smartphone. 

After 20/30 years when the busgarage site is remediated (the 

cleaning park) and there is demand, dwellings or other buildings 

can be developed on this site.
