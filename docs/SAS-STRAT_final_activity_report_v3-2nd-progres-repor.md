## 1 Abstract 

SAS-STRAT project aims at identifying, describing and analysing conditions and means for a sustainable management of cultivated soils in Europe, that takes into account a variety of current or potential qualities of these soils, including and beside agricultural production. The project relies on 3 cases studies in France, Belgium and the Netherlands: 

- The French case study focuses on the territory of the watershed of the Austreberthe, entirely     included in the department of Seine-Maritime in the Normandy region. This watershed extends to     whole or part of 31 municipalities with approximately 38,000 inhabitants and covers an area of 214     km 2. Due to strong urbanisation of valley bottoms, development of crop agriculture, a marked relief     and silty soil compacting due to rain, this territory is submitted to devastating mudflows and     sometimes overflows of rivers that can be rapid and significant. Farmers are regularly pointed out     as the cause of flooding problems but are also victims of the agricultural policy that leads to     change the type of crops and intensification of cultures. This ambiguous situation, which makes     the farmer both responsible and concerned at first order, makes farmers and their organisation     indispensable partners for managing runoff problems. 

- The Belgian case study focuses on transition pathways of soil management in the new context of     individual and collective and public policies developing “conservation agriculture” (CA). The case     is addressed through a multi-level transition perspective that focuses the analysis on Greenotec     ASBL (non-for-profit association) in Belgium. Greenotec is the unique association in the Walloon     region leading the transition towards zero tillage. It has settled experimental platforms and a frame     of extension. Greenotec has built a network of more than 200 farmers that are on the pathway of     conservation agriculture transition. More recently, Greenotec has set up contract with local     municipalities that are confronted with mud floods to connect floods issue with cropping practices.     Greenotec has also a tradition of cooperation with researchers but not yet with socio-economist     scientists. 

- The Dutch case study focuses on new impulses to increase sustainability of dairy farming in the     Beemster polder, with special attention to sustainable soil management of the underlying     grassland and arable lands. The polder ‘the Beemster’ is located in the province of North Holland.     It was dried during the period 1609 through 1612 and is included in the UNESCO World Heritage     sites. CONO dairy farmers cooperative has a factory in the polder since early 1900, which notably     produces the Beemster cheese. “Ben & Jerry’s” ice-cream company and CONO use a score for     environmental impact of dairy production to underpin their sustainability program Caring Dairy.     This score is now tested within a broad group of participating dairy farmers. Although only 30% of     the CONO farmers are located in the Beemster, CONO can be seen as an innovative case.     CONO is leading in sustainable dairy production in the Netherlands. Main characteristic of the new     system was that it is a visual method of scoring the quality. With the visual method farmers get     better knowledge of their soil, which CONO is willing to reward when they achieve better scores     on ‘happy planet’. The transversal analysis of these case studies focused on three themes: 

- Sustainable soil quality management as an issue of transition in socio-technical systems: trouble     in the “regime” (mainstream practices) and self-locking effects on current practice 

- Integrated soil quality management is a multi-stakeholder and multi-level strategy for taking in     charge soil quality as a common good shared within a heterogeneous network of actors 

- The role of technical and scientific tools as a support for facilitating transition and complexity     management: the role of “intermediary objects” supporting exchanges and negotiation between     various expert and non-expert actors and the specific contribution of actors in a position of     scientific and technical mediation. This transversal analysis and the proposed recommendations were developed in cooperation with stakeholders, who contribute with their own expertise on integrated soil quality. This was made possible notably through an Integration workshop (Paris, 17 th^ - 18 th^ June 2013) that gathered stakeholders from the studied cases, the SAS-STRAT research team and other stakeholders. The current report covers the whole period of the project (1 st^ October 2011 – 15 th^ March 2014). 


## 2 Project summary 

SAS-STRAT project aims at identifying, describing and analysing conditions and means for a sustainable management of cultivated soils in Europe, that takes into account a variety of current or potential qualities of these soils, including and beside agricultural production. The project is developed by Mutadis (coordinator), ADEPRINA (France), Sol et Civilisation (France), the University of Liège (ULg, Belgium) and Boerenverstand (Netherlands). The project relies on 3 cases studies in France, Belgium and the Netherlands This research is developed in strong cooperation with stakeholders, who contribute with their own expertise on integrated soil quality. 

### 2.1 Objectives 

The objectives of the research project are to: 

- explore what are the different qualities that constitute the integrated agricultural soil quality (e.g.     support for economical activities and income generation, including agriculture ; land planning ;     property as a place where to exert its individual freedom and as a patrimony to hand down ;     environnemental compartment and object of ecosystem services transactions; vector of chemical     quality of our environment and health, etc.) 

- describe regional governance approaches experimented in Belgium, France and the Netherlands     in the European context to improve the integrated quality of agricultural soil (case studies) 

- analyse the conditions for an integration of new soil challenges (biodiversity, climate change,     ecosystemic, cultural, identity and social... services) in agricultural soil 

- establish a community of stakeholders involved in integrated quality of soil, at local, regional,     national and European level (Belgium, France, Netherlands, EU), and a first group of researchers-     experts involved on integrated soil quality 

- analyse with stakeholders the lessons learnt from the case studies investigated, consider the     value of these experiences for the wider community, and develop in cooperation with stakeholders     recommendations for the development of integrated approach, combining regional and local     initiatives, national and EU policy 

- analyse the contribution of cooperative research methodologies to address soil complexity, and     provide recommendations to sustainable management of soil quality 

### 2.2 The 3 phases of the project 

The project has developed in 3 phases: 

- Development of a common methodological framework ensuring intercomparability of the 3 case     studies 

- Development of the 3 case studies 

- Integration of the lessons learnt from the 3 case studies. This was notably done through a     participatory Integration Workshop to be organised in Paris on 17 th^ - 18 th^ June 2013. 


Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Reporting period for the midterm report 


### 2.3 Expected results 

The results of this project will highlight fundamental elements about how to positively take into account the different qualities the concerned stakeholders relate to the soil into an integrative and multiple stakeholders soil management strategy. Doing so, it will 

- outline ways of integrating soil ecosystem services into decision making and governance ; 

- analyse and provide recommendations on methodologies and strategies to build a multiple     stakeholder and multiple quality decision making ; 

- outline solutions for a more sustainable agriculture and agricultural management. The results of the project will contribute to define the modalities of integration of soil functions and services at the different levels of decision-making and governance. They will notably illustrate and analyse how innovative arrangements between companies, governments, citizens and social organisations can ensure that both individual and social values (multi-actor) are adequately included in the assessment and decision-making processes. They will describe and analyse how to deal with complexity and uncertainty in the natural and social systems in decision-making processes. The cooperative research nature of the project will ensure dissemination of the research, by sharing the knowledge of existing local, national and European approaches, and by involving key stakeholders in the production of research and recommendations. 

### 2.4 Progress 

#### 2.4.1 Development of a common methodological framework 

Each case study is developed by a national research team (ADEPRINA, Sol et Civilisation and Mutadis for France, ULg for Belgium and Boerenverstnad for the Netherlands). Each national research teams has been developing research methodologies in their respective context. In this “Methodological work package” SAS-STRAT research team has established a common framework in the three first months of the project, to include the following common features in the methodology used in each country: 

- the understanding of “soil”, “soil quality” and related questions, 

- challenges as they are analysed by the soil research community in the country or local context     concerned, and by the stakeholders (farmers, public authorities, industry...), This common methodological framework developed by SAS-STRAT (deliverable D3-1) includes: 

- Common hypothesis and assumptions 

- Common grid of analysis 

- Common principles 

- Common questions to be tackled during the interviews with stakeholders in a each case study 

- Cross-fertilisation between the different methods At the end of the process, research teams revealed some key elements of reflexive analysis of the implementation of cooperatives methodologies applied to soil quality 

#### 2.4.2 French case study 

The territory of the French case study was not identified at the beginning of the project and has been identified in the first phase of the work of he French research team. The French case study focuses on the territory of the watershed of the Austreberthe, entirely included in the department of Seine-Maritime in the Normandy region. This watershed extends to whole or part of 31 municipalities with approximately 38,000 inhabitants and covers an area of 214 km 2. 


Land mapping shows a strong urbanisation of valley bottoms, development of crop agriculture, a marked relief and silty soil compacting due to rain. This encourages large water flows in the dry valleys. These flows cause devastating mudflows and sometimes overflows of rivers that can be rapid and significant. These phenomena are further amplified by the circular shape of the watershed that favours rapid and simultaneous concentration of water in the river. Floods are related to the fact that the rainfall during the last decade of the 20 th century, was very important, but also to the transformation of the territory (changing farming practices, urbanisation...), knowing that the soil in this territory has particular characteristics that renders it waterproof after a few rainfalls if it is not covered by cultures (capping phenomenon). Farmers are regularly pointed out as the cause of flooding problems but are also victims of the agricultural policy that leads to change the type of crops and intensification of cultures. This ambiguous situation, which makes the farmer both responsible and concerned at first order, makes farmers and their organisation indispensable partners for managing runoff problems. Whether for the evolution of cultural practices across watersheds or for the realisation of landscaping or facilities, farmers must be involved in various projects. The French case study relies on a cooperative research methodology, the patrimonial audit method developed by H. Ollagnon^1 , involving stakeholders in the investigation of the quality of a problem – here the integrated quality of soil – , considered as a complex and multi-stakeholder issue. This method involves interviews with a pluralistic group of 36 stakeholders and soil sciences researchers. The research team responsible for the French case study has 

- Identified the precise territory and issue on which the French case study is focusing, 

- Set up the coordination framework with the stakeholders concerned by the case study, including     identification of the list of stakeholders to be interviewed, 

- Produced a bibliography, 

- Organised meeting and interviewed 36 stakeholders. 

- Presented the interim results of the patrimonial audit to to the partners and to the SAS-STRAT     research tem during the 2nd SAS-STRAT research meeting in Normandy (Barentin, 24 th^ - 26 th     October 2012). 

- Wrote the synthesis report 

- Made an oral presentation of the results, which took place on Monday 18 th^ March 2013 in     Normandy. All the 36 interviewed were invited, 18 people were present. A presentation of the interim results of the patrimonial audit will be presented to stakeholders and to the SAS-STRAT research tem during the 2nd SAS-STRAT research meeting in Normandy (Barentin, 24 th^ - 26 th^ October 2012). 

#### 2.4.3 Belgian case study 

This research has addressed the issue of soil quality through the analysis of farmers' transition to conservation agriculture 2 (CA) in the Walloon region (Belgium). Conservation agriculture is an agricultural model that aims to maintain soil fertility and prevent soil erosion through the application of principles such as minimal soil disturbance (reduced tillage), permanent soil cover and crop rotation. For farmers, reduced tillage techniques are first a solution for technical or economic problems: they permit the cultivation of very stony or clayey soil and they allow fuel and labour saving. Simultaneously, conservation agriculture meets current societal and political concerns about soil quality: its abilities to maintain soil fertility and prevent soil erosion allow conservation agriculture to be considered as a tool for the preservation of soil quality.

The Belgian case study focuses on transition pathways of soil management in the new context of individual and collective and public policies developing “conservation agriculture” (CA). The case is addressed through a multi-level transition perspective that focuses the analysis on Greenotec ASBL (non-for-profit association) in Belgium. Greenotec is the unique association in the Walloon region leading the transition towards zero tillage. It has settled experimental platforms and a frame of extension. Greenotec has built a network of more than 200 farmers that are on the pathway of conservation agriculture transition. More recently, Greenotec has set up contract with local municipalities that are confronted with mud floods to connect floods issue with cropping practices. Greenotec has also a tradition of cooperation with researchers but not yet with socio-economist scientists. The analysis is positioned within the multi-level perspective set out by Geels (2002) and Geels and Schot (2007). In this perspective, transitional processes are interpreted as dynamic interactions between three analytical levels: the niches of innovation, the regime and the landscape. This framework permits the study of the transition to conservation agriculture in relation to the dominant regime of agricultural practices. It also allows us to consider farmers' trajectories in a larger scale of analysis including other actors involved in soil quality management (mainly researchers and policy makers). The field work methodology results from this analytical multi-level perspective. We conducted field investigations at five levels: farmers' practices and trajectories, collective learning processes, Greenotec activities, Walloon public institutions and scientists. Through a micro-historical analysis of individual and collective transition pathways, the research seeks to understand how new practices around conservation agriculture can address the issue of soil quality management and open new opportunities for soil quality management for farmers, local public authority/residents and regional policy. 

#### 2.4.4 Dutch case study 

The Dutch case study focuses on new impulses to increase sustainability of dairy farming in the Beemster polder, with special attention to sustainable soil management of the underlying grassland and arable lands. The polder ‘the Beemster’ is located in the province of North Holland. It was dried during the period 1609 through 1612 and is included in the UNESCO World Heritage sites. The typical squared shape of the parcels and the grid of canals paralleling the grid of roads, which have been preserved intact, is one of the reasons that it is listed as a world heritage. CONO dairy farmers cooperative (www.cono.nl) has a factory in the polder since early 1900, which notably produces the Beemster cheese. In 2006 they adapted the sustainability program of Ben&Jerry’s ice-cream company. Within the program of Ben&Jerry’s, sustainable dairy farming was described as ‘happy people, happy cow and happy planet’. In December 2010 CONO launched an integral score for the ‘happy planet’. All 550 farmers that deliver their milk to CONO have been scored on nitrogen (N), phosphate (P) and carbon (C) on the nutrient balances. Although only 30% of the CONO farmers are located in the Beemster, CONO can be seen as an innovative case. CONO is leading in sustainable dairy production in the Netherlands. Since then they have also been looking for a better and more farmer friendly method of scoring soil quality. Main characteristic of the new system was that it is a visual method of scoring the quality. With the visual method farmers get better knowledge of their soil, which CONO is willing to reward when they achieve better scores on ‘happy planet’. In the Beemster area consist of mainly clay soils. Often the land is used for short-term profit crops like bulbs or tulips. These crops gain allot of cash in one year but are devastating for soil quality. “Ben & Jerry’s” ice-cream company and CONO use a score for environmental impact of dairy production (developed by Frank Verhoeven) to underpin their sustainability program Caring Dairy. This score is now tested within a broad group of participating dairy farmers. The criteria for scoring sustainability are in debate at the moment, but a general agreement was made between stakeholders, government and scientists. Several instruments where brought together in one score for “happy planet” (air quality, Water quality, Soil quality, Impact on climate change, Biodiversity and Footprint) The data needed for this score can also be used for a certificate and good results can be rewarded in a way that dairy farmers are stimulated to lower levels of nitrogen and phosphate surpluses and improve their soil quality. The province of Drenthe and Utrecht are using the score and searching for new ways of stimulating soil quality by measuring “farmers data” and rewarding “best practices”. 


The case study takes the form of qualitative and technical research in the form of interviews and data collection of 25 to 30 individuals on the basis of methodology defined in WP3. This case study is carried out under the form of interviews and expert meetings with farmers and relevant stakeholders (see before). Data analysis is carried out and several examples and best practices are written down and discussed. In the end, a description of sustainable soil management in relation to dairy farming is given, a list of measurements, potential scores (range of results) and the potential use for government regulation and/or ecosystem services is to be written down. Five dairy farmers were selected as ‘best practice’ farmers and compared with five conventional dairy farmers. Discussions with stakeholders also rely on a Visual Soil Assessment (VSA) tool that helps to: 

- Stimulate the discussion about sustainable soil management among the stakeholders (on the     spot), 

- Involve other stakeholders (society, governments, civilians) by scoring sustainable soil     management, 

- Make sustainable soil management accountable. The Dutch case study has achieved the following: 

- Developing the Visual Soil Assessment scoring method used in the framework of the Dutch case     study, 

- Organising a meeting of the SAS-STRAT research team in Beemster (5 th^ - 6 th^ June 2012) 

- Developing full case study that includes an analysis of the social network related to soil quality in     the Beemster area with special focus on dairy farming and the role of co-operative CONO cheese     makers and an analysis of the CONO sustainability programme as an example of development of     cycle approaches in agriculture and soil quality management. 

#### 2.4.5 Dissemination 

Dissemination works carried out included the following activities: 

- Developing a Dissemination Plan (deliverable D2-1) 

- Developing SAS-STRAT webpages publicly accessible in English, French and Dutch:     o a SAS-STRAT webpage on the Coordinator’s website in English        (http://www.mutadis.org/index.php/recherches/127-sas-strat.html) - see Annex 1.     o SAS-STRAT webpages on the websites of French, Belgian and Dutch partners of the        project (ADEPRINA/AgroParisTech, ULg, Boerenverstand) in the country language        (French for France, French for Belgium and Dutch for the Netherlands). These webpages        are referred to on the main English SAS-STRAT webpage. 

- Presenting 9 communications during conferences 

- Publishing 3 articles in scientific publications in English: 1 article in _Research Policy_ , 1 article in     _Soil Use and Management_ , 1 article in the book _Les métamorphoses du productivisme agricole._     _Pour une sociologie des grandes cultures_ , by Antoine Bernard de Raymond et Frédéric Goulet 

- Publishing 1 article in a scientific publications in Dutch ( _Bodem_ ) 

- Publishing 2 articles in a professional newspaper in Dutch ( _Nieuwe Oogst_ ) 

- Developing a Guidance for policy makers and researchers 

#### 2.4.6 Integration 

The objective of this Work Package is to develop an integration workshop (Paris, 17 th^ 18 th^ June 2013). This workshop is directed towards a pluralistic audience composed of stakeholders of the 3 case studies, decision-makers at national and European level concerned with soil quality management and soil science community 


The purpose of the workshop is to: 

- Share and validate in an European audience the results of the three “national” case studies 

- establish a shared view of the issues at stake from the three countries: 

- connect researchers and stakeholders to establish a plural network on the management of soil     quality 

- develop a shared analysis of the conditions and means of integrated soil quality with researchers     and stakeholders 

- make proposals or recommendations which can support further development of public policies and     research The Integration workshop was organised in Paris on 17 th^ and 18 th^ June 2013 and 21 actors from France, Belgium, the Nethelrlands and Switzerland (see list of participants in annex 17), including stakeholders from the French and Dutch case (stakeholders from the Belgian case were invited but did not come), external stakeholders from France and Switzerland, members of the SAS-STRAT Steering Committee and the SAS-STRAT research team. The programme of the seminar (see annex 16 ) included 4 sessions: 

- Session 1: Presentation of the results of the case studies (and discussion with participants). 

- Session 2: Lessons learnt from the case studies (and disussion with the participants). 

- Session 3 : Strategic diagnosis of the stakes and challenges for integrated soil quality     management in Europe (see annex 20). 

- Session 4 : Recommendations - how to create conditions for actors' practices to take into     account integrated soil quality. The final version of the transversal analysis of the case studies (see section 6.7.2.2) was then produced incorporating stakeholders’ input. This transversal analysis is developed according to 3 key themes identified by the research team: 

- Sustainable soil quality management, a problem of transition in socio-technical systems:     trouble within the regime and self-locking effects on current practice 

- Taking complexity into account in soil quality management 

- Contributions of scientific and technical tools to soil quality management Finally, recommendations (see section 6.7.2.3) were developed on the basis of the transversal analysis and of the discussions with the participants of the integration workshop.

## 4 Background / need / adequateness of the work 

## made 

Since the late 1990s, research on soil has been considerably developing in Europe. The international conference on soil sciences held in Montpellier in 1998 was a major milestone to recognize soil as a natural element as important as water and air. Its importance is related to the fact that soil is a support to many activities essential to human life (for a long time, it was even considered only from a food perspective), but also it is a system in itself, on which topical questions today (biodiversity, climate change...) are dependent. 

### 4.1 Soil quality is a multi-faceted issue 

Karlen et al. (1997) define soil quality as ' the capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and support human health and habitation' (Schuman. 1997. Soil quality: A concept, definition, and framework for evaluation. Soil Sci. Soc. Amer. J. 61:4-10). This definition and its discussion have underpinned the research developments in the first decade of the 21st century. It reflects the acknowledgment of the research and policy community that soil is a multifaceted question. In the policy field, the memorandum for the draft soil directive as of 2006 explains that Soil is “essentially a non-renewable resource and a very dynamic system which performs many functions and delivers services vital to human activities and ecosystems survival. Information available suggests that, over recent decades, there has been a significant increase of soil degradation processes, and there is evidence that they will further increase if no action is taken.” The proposal has the objective of “establishing a common strategy for the protection and sustainable use of soil based on the principles of integration of soil concerns into other policies, preservation of soil functions within the context of sustainable use, prevention of threats to soil and mitigation of their effects, as well as restoration of degraded soils to a level of functionality consistent at least with the current and approved future use.” There are a number of understandings for soils: physical and biological substrate, environment, support to fauna and flora, place of human living, encompassing a wide range of economic, cultural and social uses and values, to name but a few. Although the multi-dimensionality of soil is now widely recognized, soil research has been mainly focussing on physics and biology. Research on soil quality management in the field of humanities is still limited. This may be explained by the fact that soil is seldom an issue in itself for social and political sciences, but only a related object to other issues (urbanisation, agriculture, protection of the environment). The emergence of the concept of ecosystemic services has given further strength to the recognition of the multiple qualities and functions of soil. Soil cannot be reduced to one dimension. Research has thus helped identify potential conflicts of use or value, which threaten the sustainable management of soils and the need for mediation (Doussan I., Activité agricole et droit de l'environnement, l'impossible conciliation ?, Paris, L’Harmattan, Logiques juridiques, 2002 ; Citeau L., Bispo A., Bardy M., King, D.(coord), Gestion durable des sols, Paris, Quae, 1998). Under the French research program GESSOL, research currently conducted by the University Paul Cézanne AixMarseille-3 stresses that soil remains in France a fragmented legal object, despite the draft EU directive. In this respect soil is strongly associated with complexity and the policy and research developments clearly show the need of a better integration of the various uses and functions related to soil. 

### 4.2 Soil quality and complexity 

Soil is a complex element: it has intrinsic qualities (physical, chemical, biological), but is an environment that is both natural and human. It is difficult to separate fully the qualities of each other like a growing number of objects that are situated between humanity and nature (Latour B., Nous n'avons jamais été modernes. Essai d'anthropologie symétrique, Paris, La Découverte, 2006 (éd. 


originale, 1991)). Soil tightly integrates physical, chemical and biological qualities, and social and human qualities. Like for any other complex issue, the complexity of soils can not be reduced by a clinical examination that would separate from each other the different qualities and soil functions and would not take into account their interdependence and interactions deep (H. Simon, The science of the artificial, (1969), MIT Press; Latour, ibid; Ollagnon, H., 2006, La gestion de la biodiversité : quelles strategies patrimoniales ?, Annales des Mines n°44) 

### 4.3 Agricultural soil: an outstanding case for soil complexity 

### and integration 

Soil complexity is particularly obvious as regards agricultural soil. This type of soil currently faces a number of challenges related to complexity and lack of integration. Among new developments impacting agricultural soil in Europe conservation agriculture with new approaches, e.g. non-ploughing, by producing change reveal the complexity of soil management. These approaches build on the quality of the soil and the different functions of cover plants (soil protection, improvement of biodiversity, and soil structure, carbon storage...). They improve the biological quality of soil, can prevent from erosion while they often need to increase the use of pesticides. They also provoke changes in the relations among farmers, as well as in the relations between farmers and other stakeholders (local and central authorities, experts, industry...) (Triomphe B, et al., Du labour au non-labour : pratiques, innovations et enjeux au Sud et au Nord, in Bourrigaud R. et Sigaut F (dir.), Actes du colloque Techniques de travail de la terre, hier et aujourd’hui, ici et làbas, Nantes, 2007). The impacts of these changes for soil quality only begin to be assessed, often from a single perspective, while there is a clear interaction between soil quality, agronomic technology, food industry, pesticides industry, regulation, etc. Most recently, biodiversity and climate change have started to consider soil as a key element in coping strategies (Hans Hurni, Markus Giger, and Konrad Meyer, editors. 2006. Soils on the global agenda. Developing International Mechanisms for Sustainable Land Management. IASUS Working Group of the International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS). Centre for Development and Environment, Bern. pp. 18 25). Agricultural soils are one of the prior fields of action given the importance of their impact on both these issues. What are the relations between climate change, biodiversity and soil quality? Is biodiversity a driver for a better integration of the different functions and values of soil? What about climate change? How to ensure that the consideration of these new concerns enhances integration of the various soil services, rather than they spoil it? Are there examples of good strategies in this respect? What is the quality of agricultural soil? How to maintain, and improve this quality? What can be the complementary contribution of EU and national policy and of regional and local practices? The EU and the member states often regulate on a normative basis, for example fixing targets for pollutants, or for biodiversity, and defining normative ways to reach these targets. These objectives are regularly challenged by stakeholders at local level. Farmers in the Netherlands have for instance argued that they can meet the target for ammonia emission with other methods than the ones authorised by regulation (Sonneveld A.P.W. and al, A Whole Farm Strategy to reduce Environmental Impacts of Nitrogen, in Journal of Environmental Quality, vol. 37, January-February 2008), and they have obtained an regime of exception, at least for a limited time. In France, the hexagonal rural development program (Programme de développement rural hexagonal) proposed a bottom up approach, giving rooms for negotiation between stakeholders at local level to find appropriate ways to meet national and European targets (e.g. Natura 2000), taking into account the particular assets and limits of the local territory. These developments reflect the fact that in the face of complexity integration is best achieved at local level. In this respect the management of soil is strongly related to local governance. In a 2008 paper “Toward robust regions: rural-urban transitions in the metropolitan landscape”, Han Wiskerke reminds that the supply of goods and services has become less and less regional in the past decades, and therefore more and more disconnected from the place where they are purchased and consumed (Wiskerke H., “Toward robust regions: rural-urban transitions in the metropolitan landscape”Conference Transitions towards sustainable agriculture, food chains and peri-urban areas, Wageningen, 26-29 october 2008). He reports a wide variety of rural and regional development 


initiatives in Europe that try to connect various players and stakeholders, to embed good and services in the region, building on its natural and social capital. We can argue in continuation, that soil is a major issue to reconnect local actors and the different activities and values – existing and potential – present in their community. The connection and integration at local level can be a major path to sustainability. During three years the implementation of activities generating impacts and risks for humans and nature in nine European territories, the TRUSTNET IN ACTION (TIA) European cooperative research project (2003-2006) has underlined the need for inclusive multilevel governance experimentation as a means to restore the conditions for local actors to initiate and drive sustainable development, while traditional governmental policies confronted with complexity demonstrate little efficiency as regards environment protection and may increase the vulnerability of human activities at territorial level. The recognition of complexity is a first step to sustainability. The second and no less important step is the capacity to address this complexity by developing strategies that take into account the variety of uses and values of soil and their interactions. 

### 4.4 A need for a multidisciplinary and pluralist approach 

The proposed research aims at: 

- Describing current strategies developed at regional level to cope with the need for a greater     integration of soil uses and functions (understood as total soil quality) 

- Analysing the conditions and means for such an integration 

- Analysing their relations to national and European levels of governance 

- Proposing recommendations to policy makers and practitioners In this respect, it is important to develop a multidisciplinary and pluralist approach that can account both the issues related to the intrinsic qualities of the soil, its social qualities, and people’s skills (in the meaning of relationships between the soil and the people), by observing them in their entirety and complexity. As a number of environmental or complex issues, it can be assumed that sustainable soil management needs to establish a dialogue between policy-makers, the research community and stakeholders, not only to enrich knowledge but also to make sure science and policy orientations are line with social concerns, and take into account existing natural and human contexts. A specificity of this research is thus to combine a multidisciplinary perspective with a co-operative methodology. The co-operative methodology will contribute the quality of the research as well as the practicability of the results for it will bring territorial experience and local expertise in the project. The expected result is to produce a global and dynamic picture of the conditions and means for the total quality of soil. It will bring a specific understanding of the horizontal interactions that are operated at territorial level (between categories of local actors). It will also bring understanding of the vertical interactions between local actors and communities and the three majors spheres of decision that are impacting the territory, namely the public sphere (public authorities and policies at national and European levels), the private sphere (industry, business) and the scientific and technological sphere (public and private research). 

## 5 Objectives of the project 

SAS-STRAT aims at identifying, describing and analysing conditions and means for a sustainable management of cultivated soils in Europe, that takes into account a variety of current or potential qualities of these soils, including and beside agricultural production. The objectives of the research project are to: 


- Explore what are the different qualities that constitute the integrated agricultural soil quality (e.g.     support for economical activities and income generation, including agriculture; land planning;     property as a place where to exert its individual freedom and as a patrimony to hand down;     environmental compartment and object of ecosystem services transactions; vector of chemical     quality of our environment and health, etc.) 

- Describe regional governance approaches experimented in Belgium, France and the Netherlands     in the European context to improve the integrated quality of agricultural soil (case studies) 

- Analyse the conditions for an integration of new soil challenges (biodiversity, climate change,     ecosystemic, cultural, identity and social... services) in agricultural soil 

- Establish a community of stakeholders involved in integrated quality of soil, at local, regional,     national and European level (Belgium, France, Netherlands, EU), and a first group of researchers-     experts involved on integrated soil quality 

- Analyse with stakeholders the lessons learnt from the case studies investigated, consider the     value of these experiences for the wider community, and develop in cooperation with stakeholders     recommendations for the development of integrated approach, combining regional and local     initiatives, national and EU policy 

- Analyse the contribution of cooperative research methodologies to address soil complexity, and     provide recommendations to sustainable management of soil quality In order to do so, the research developed within SAS-STRAT: 

- Sets up a common methodological framework to implement cooperative research methodologies     along the same objectives in the three countries (WP3) 

- Prepares and analyses case studies in three regional countries to obtain feedback on the     multidimensionality of soil quality as experienced in three different contexts, and hindrances and     positive factors in the development of integrated management of agricultural soil. (WP 4, 5, and 6) 

- Structures an exchange of experiences between the three countries, with a direct involvement of     stakeholders met during the case studies‘ interviews; complement the case studies with a     European meeting of co-expertise, soliciting the expertise of scientists (including from the     "SNOWMAN community") and the expertise of specialists and professionals involved in the case     studies, with a view to reach through dialogue shared proposals or recommendations (WP7) 

- Disseminates the results in the research community through scientific publications (WP2)

**6.1.2.3 Cross-fertilisation seminars** During the 2 nd^ meeting of SAS-STRAT partners (Brussels, 17 th^ January 2012), the partners of the projects commonly agreed that it was necessary, in order to enable integration between the 3 case studies and cross-fertilisation of the different methodological approaches, that all partners to have direct contact with all 3 cases (which was not initially foreseen in SAS-STRAT description of work) and discuss the cases together during regular meeting points in the course of the process of developing the case studies. This led the consortium decide to organise three “cross-fertilisation seminars”, one for each case, divided into three parts: 

- A participatory session in which the SAS-STRAT research team meets the stakeholders.     During this session,        o The current development of the case study is presented to the whole SAS-STRAT           research team and to stakeholders of the concerned case        o The research team deepens its understanding of the cases through discussion with           the stakeholders 

- A Visual soil assessment session during which the VSA method developed in the framework     of the Dutch case study is implemented in the field 

- A research team session in which the SAS-STRAT research team     o Debriefs the two first session and discusses the considered case     o Discusses project management issues The 3 seminars have been organised at the following places and dates: 

- The Netherlands (Beemster polder): 5 th^ and 6 th^ June 2012 

- France (Barentin, Normandy): 24 th^ to 26 th^ October 

- Belgium (Namur, Walloon region): 20 th^ and 21 st^ March 2013

### 6.3 WP3: Construction of a common methodological 

### framework 

#### 6.3.1 Objectives 

There are several challenges proposed in SNOWMAN call 3 to address the complexity of soil management in the perspective of sustainable management. This encompasses: widening the community of researchers involved on soil beyond the community of researchers on pollutants and contamination; encourage pluridisciplinarity; include the participation of stakeholders. In this respect, there is a need to implement cooperative research methodologies that are able to meet these challenges in the context of soil quality, building on the previous experience of the research team members. By experimenting, we mean implementing these methodologies in this field, and in retrospect analysing in a reflexive way the capacity and limits of these research methodologies, and the possible adaptations, and developments requested. In this “Methodological work package” the research team will pursue the following objectives: 

- The definition of a methodological framework to conduct case studies in the three countries     according to the cooperative methodologies of each national team, with common objectives 

- A reflexive analysis of the implementation of cooperative research methodologies in the field     of soil quality, and recommendations to further use of these methodologies in this field 

#### 6.3.2 Description of the work process 

The « Common methodological framework » has been developed in two stages based on the national methodology of each case study that will contribute to the general objectives of the project: inform, document and conceptualize soil quality issues in a perspective of sustainability. 1) First, the coordination level between the three cases study. As a result of the exchanges and meetings of the research partners of SAS-STRAT in the first months of the project, the research teams have incorporated elements of each specific methodology in the different methods of data collection that will be used in the three countries SAS-STRAT focuses on. A common grid for the interviews was developed. This work was carried out during two interdisciplinary seminars (Paris, November 7, 2011 and Brussels, 17 January 2012) and during a conference call on December 6, 2011. 2) Secondly, this coordination has been and will be strengthened during workshops that have been organized approximately every 6 months by the partners (one workshop in each of the 3 countries of the project: Netherlands, 5 th^ and 6 th^ June 2012; France, 24 th^ and 25 th^ October 2012; Belgium, 20 th^ and 21 st^ March 2013). These workshops were twofold: a field work session (1 st^ day) during which each team puts into practice its tools and a research seminar session (2 nd^ day). One of the problems of soil issue is interdisciplinarity. Technical and social boundaries are not predefined and call for multidisciplinary approach. Our experience is that common field experience is the best background to build a common concern, common language and common understanding of the institutional context (landscape-regime). Field experience is not field visit. It means that something happens that makes feel what are the stakes and the context within the study case. The second day research seminars were a place of first level co-learning by debriefing the field experience and coordination/planning of the future actions. Coordination is a question of experience, exchange and planning. More than that, the method used in the Dutch case study involves a “participatory soil profiles” method, that is easy to transport from one field of research to others field of research. This method has been tested in France and Belgium. After each of the seminars, each research team has written a briefing note to propose a review, from their own concepts, of the situation. At the end of the process, elements of these notes were taken into account in the final integration work. 3) At the end of the process research, a conference call with members of the research team has identified some key elements of reflexive analysis of the implementation of cooperatives methodologies applied to soil quality. 


#### 6.3.3 Short description of the content of the methodological framework 

The interdisciplinary reflections carried out by SAS-STRAT research team have led to develop a common methodological framework structured into five parts that are briefly developed hereunder. **6.3.3.1 Common hypothesis and assumptions** In order to move from a description of the multiple dimensions of soil to an analysis of the conditions for an integrated management of soil, the research team considers a cooperative research methodology is most needed. Integration needs to engage experts and stakeholders because they are directly engaged in soil management, they have knowledge about a particular dimension (e.g. related to soil contamination, to an agricultural practice, or to land value...), and they contribute to build a holistic understanding of soil quality, with the different dimensions, and their relations. **6.3.3.2 Common grid of analysis** Each of the cases represents a situation in which integrated management of soil quality is explicitly accomplished. It is approached as a complex and multi-stakeholders issue and in a dynamic perspective of improvement of this management. Each case: 

- puts at stake a great number of dimensions related to soils, 

- represents situations in which an explicit integrated management of the soil quality is pursued in     the concerned territories, 

- involves a co-evolution learning process for a better soil quality management, 

- involves a great number of stakeholders concerned with the future of soils and their management, 

- involves actors willing to improve their practice of integrated soil quality management. A common grid of analysis (see Annex 2 ) was developed and included into deliverable D3-1: Methodological framework: issues and cooperative research methodology to address integrated soil quality (2 nd^ May 2012) **6.3.3.3 Common principles** The actors interviewed in the three case studies are considered as co-expert of their situation. The process led to a co-expertise process based on scientific expertise, pragmatic expertise... Each team uses common guidelines and requirements on which type of actors are to be met for each case study. In all cases we seek for a strategic representation rather than a statistical representation, i.e. we seek to meet key actors who in their institutional or effective position have a great ability to influence the situation For each considered case, the research team responsible for the case study interviews each actor asking a same strategic question – such as "conditions and means for a better integrated sustainable management of soil quality" (to be specified for each territory). Ethical rules are defined in order to secure the meeting and communication with the actors. The different research teams will pay particular attention to the historical trajectory of soil management in the considered cases. The practitioners-researchers will not only observe the knowledge, practices and capacities of the actors, but they also facilitate the evolution of the system to improve sustainable management of soil quality. **6.3.3.4 Common questions to be tackled** During the interviews, each actor will express elements regarding his/her analysis of the situation following four topics: 

- Identification of the qualities at stake and the problems met 

- Diagnosis of current actions, particularly individual actions, collective actions (regulations) and the     "mode of action of the actors together" 


- Anticipation of evolutions and problems (or projects), especially if public policies regarding soil     management were to be strengthened 

- Proposals for actions, particularly in terms of governance. **6.3.3.5 Cross-fertilisation between the different methods** While this cross-fertilisation between the different methods of research teams were not originally planned, the three research teams have wanted to go further in integrating their different methods. At first, the research teams wanted to incorporate element of each specific methodology in data collection. A common grid for the interviews was developed. Before the final seminar, summary reports for each national case was written by taking the framework of the common grid of analysis which has allowed easy identification of cross-cutting lessons to different cases. 

#### 6.3.4 Key elements of reflexive analysis of the implementation of 

#### cooperatives methodologies applied to soil quality 

The research team had to address the following questions: 

- capacity of these methodologies to describe the various dimensions of soil quality; 

- capacity of these methodologies to achieve with researchers and stakeholders an integrated     view of soil quality; For both these capacities, the analysis outlines 

- particular sensitive aspects or difficulties in achieving this description/integration; 

- possible adaptations or development requested to fit to the specificities of soil complexity”. First, the research team would underline that these are relevant questions, and it is difficult to address these keys issues in the contract that is ours. It is impossible to make exhaustive responses. Also, this part of the report aims to outline possible answers, not so much from the point of view of cooperative research in general but by focusing on lessons for the Snowman network. Work on soil quality raises fundamental questions. It is difficult to address these issues without precaution for scientists as by private actors. Firstly, soil is a private property, which is not the case of water, air or biodiversity. Secondly, “soil quality” is a general concept that must be declined in each specific context. It involves a clinical approach to the question of the relevant entity, which varies greatly according to soil conditions, territories, country, history... **6.3.4.1 Do stakeholders feel cocerned?** To initiate collaborative research, a key point is to ensure that stakeholders are concerned about the quality of soil, and are sufficiently concerned to participate in such a process. It is difficult to fully answer this issue, however some indicators are in line with a real concernment. In the three territories, the issue of "managing soil quality" was seen as a relevant issue but stakeholders replaced the soil issues in relation to their problems. Moreover, such a cooperative research was relevant for public actors also. There is a real interest to resort to this type of research to better define public policy on such complex issues. **6.3.4.2 Emergence of an integrated view of soil quality?** This is not a universal definition of soil quality that emerges from this collaborative research, but elements of processes that allow each territory, in agreement with scientists and with the government, to define its soil quality. **6.3.4.3 What were the difficulties encountered in the implementation of cooperative research?** A first difficulty in the SAS-STRAT methodology was the fact that each case study has been developed by a different research team with its own method. Although common elements (through the common methodological framework) were incorporated in each case study, this common methodological framework represented an adjustment of each team’s own method rather than a 


unified framework of data collection and analysis (which would have required more resources to develop). Secondly, in this case and to bring a real added value, the cooperative research should not only aim to collect the expertise of local actors, but should also investigate possible convergence with other forms of expertise. **6.3.4.4 What are the lessons learnt for further development of cooperative research in the field of soil quality?** Progress on the issue of agricultural soil quality management, involving multiple stakeholders, is necessarily germination process in each territory as at European level, which requires time. So, to progress at the same time at these different levels, knowing that the action is based on the involvement of multiple stakeholders, assist actors at local level and at European level is necessary. Different topics to deepen the reflection with multi stakeholders were discussed during our research, such as develop tools to better visualize and manage “together” the "total soil quality" (the VSA score, developed by the Dutch team, could be one of them), developing new modes of governance of soil quality, based on the strong commitment of stakeholders (in particular, explore the concepts of "common", “common good”, "common management”) or developing policies and tools for supporting transition processes in farmers’ practices and helping to lift socio-technical locks that hinder this transition. The Integration workshop (Paris, 17 th 

- 18     th        June 2103) organized it the participation of stakeholders (from and outside of the case studies) and public authorities has shown that exchanges of experience on the basis of case studies and of their transversal analysis at a European or transnational level is a useful tool for developing a common ground between practitioners, market actors, experts and policy makers. In particular, the fact that this exercise was not directly connected to a decision-making process facilitated the discussion and cooperation and helped all types of stakeholders. 


### 6.4 WP4: Case study: France 

#### 6.4.1 Objectives 

The objective of this work package is to conduct a case study in France to analyse: 

- different soil qualities as they are identified and experienced by the soil 

- research community and stakeholders in a given region 

- challenges of improving soil quality in relation to conflicting situations of soil functions in this region 

- hindrances and positive factors in initiatives to integrate different soil functions and values, for     soils concerned by farming 

- new impulses for sustainable soil management In the course of this case study, stakeholders (e.g. farmers, experts, local and central administration, NGOs, industry, etc.) are invited to analyse their situation, and the issues of total soil quality, and will identify among them prospective French participants for the final dissemination workshop. 

#### 6.4.2 Context of the case study 

The watershed of Austreberthe extends to whole or part of 31 municipalities with approximately 38,000 inhabitants and covers an area of 214 km 2 entirely included in the department of Seine Maritime. The watershed of the Austreberthe has two streams. The Austreberthe River has a length of 18 km and its only tributary, the Saffimbec, runs for 3 kilometres. The Austreberthe rooted in Sainte Austreberthe (altitude: 85 meters) and flows into the Seine from Duclair, situated downstream Rouen. The maintenance of these two rivers is provided by the Syndicat Intercommunal des Rivières d’Austreberthe et de Saffimbec (SIRAS). Land mapping shows a strong urbanisation of valley bottoms, development of crop agriculture, a marked relief and silty soil compacting due to rain. This encourages large water flows in the dry valleys. These flows cause devastating mudflows and sometimes overflows of rivers that can be rapid and significant. These phenomena are further amplified by the circular shape of the watershed that favours rapid and simultaneous concentration of water in the river. The watershed of Austreberthe has always suffered from three types of flooding: floods caused by overflow of the river, floods caused by a rise of water tables, flood caused by water runoff. Floods are related to the fact that the rainfall during the last decade of the 20 th^ century, was very important, but also to the transformation of the territory (changing farming practices, urbanisation...), knowing that the soil in this territory has particular characteristics that renders it waterproof after a few rainfalls if it is not covered by cultures (capping phenomenon). Since 1983, 100% of the municipalities in the watershed have been subject of a declaration of natural disaster. The catchment area of the territory is Austreberthe sensitive to flooding and erosion. This area has a number of drinking water wells and 18 km of river that are sensitive to pollution. Problems related to runoff have, in many cases, a direct impact on agriculture, which results in damage to crops and / or consequent loss of production. Potential impacts are: 

- Emergence of gully erosion in the slope axis or at sharp slope changes, inducing:     o Regular filling works (representing additional costs)     o Sometimes significant difficulties to exploit plots (bypass gullies);     o Loss of production... 


- Non-arable areas because of regular flooding; 

- Submersion of cultures; 

- Erosion causing loss of silt on the upper areas and filling of lower areas inducing differentiation of     land. Farmers are regularly pointed out as the cause of flooding problems but are also victims of the agricultural policy that leads to change the type of crops and intensification of cultures. Land transfer rates related to sheet erosion on slopes is ranging from 7 to 10 t / ha / year, which is considerable. This ambiguous situation, which makes the farmer both responsible and concerned at first order, makes farmers and their organisation indispensable partners for managing runoff problems. Whether for the evolution of cultural practices across watersheds or for the realisation of landscaping or facilities, farmers must be involved in various projects. 

#### 6.4.3 Method for the case study 

The research investigates the conditions and means of a comprehensive and sustainable management of soil quality, encompassing a variety of soil functions in the considered territory of the case study. The research was developed through several stages: 

- Identification of one territory with particular challenges as regards soil quality; 

- For the case, identification of the main stakeholders involved and concerned on the different     qualities and functions of soil (e. g. agriculture, water management, land planning, biodiversity,     climate change...) 

- Synthesis of the strategy for soil quality management in France (state of the art of available     research, notably from GESSOL and SNOWMAN research) 

- Conduct of interviews with a pluralistic group of about 25 to 30 stakeholders and with soil sciences     researchers, on the basis of a cooperative research methodology (here on the basis of the     patrimonial audit method developed by H. Ollagnon 3 , which constitutes a cooperative research     tool involving stakeholders in the investigation of the quality of a problem – here the integrated     quality of soil - , considered as a complex and multi-stakeholder issue); The patrimonial audit     investigates a common strategic issue with the stakeholder group. The stakeholders are     interviewed in semi-directive way and the interviews were guided by the common grid of analysis     of SAS-STRAT developed in WP3. 

- Preparation of a case study report outlining:     o the main issues and challenges related to soil quality in the territories considered, the different        understanding of soil quality by researchers and stakeholders     o the diagnosis of the actions that have been undertaken so far in order to solve these        problems: what is the current management strategy for soil and what are its results in terms of        qualities?     o Forecasting: reporting stakeholders’ analysis on the likely evolution of the situation in terms of        issues at stakes, threats and assets     o Action: stakeholders’ objectives and propositions, in terms of strategy and actions, to address        the issue of comprehensive and sustainable soil quality.

#### 6.4.4 Work process 

**6.4.4.1 Preliminary identification of the territory of investigation for the French case study** In the case of France, the case to be studied was not identified during the preparation phase of SASSTRAT and was not specified in the Description of work of the project. The first step of WP4 has therefore been to identify the case study and the precise territory where the investigations will be led, relying on the network of Sol & Civilisation in French rural territories. Two types of territories where considered, both of them being rural territories: a territory with soil quality issues around vineyards and a territory in Normandy, where there is a major issue of erosion linked notably to agricultural practices. Contacts were taken into the two types of territories to assess feasibility and conditions for carrying out a case study. These first contacts led the research team to deepen at first the contacts in Normandy and meet Mr Ouvry, manager of the Regional Association for Soils Study and Improvement in HauteNormandie (Association Régionale pour l’Étude et l’Amélioration des Sols de Haute-Normandie AREAS) 4. **6.4.4.2 Identification of the precise territory to be covered by the case study (meeting with the management of the AREAS in Normandy)** The research team met Jean-François Ouvry, Executive Director of the AREAS, on Wednesday 22 th August 2012, in order to: 

- Present him the SAS-STRAT project; 

- Precise the regional problematic about soil quality; 

- Determine the territory where a patrimonial audit could be led; 

- Determine the list of the “macro-stakeholders” to interview in the patrimonial audit, i.e. the     scientific experts of soils and the national, regional and departmental stakeholders concerned by     the issue. The AREAS is a non-for-profit organisation, created in 1985, which works on streaming, erosion and phytosanitary products flows, mainly in rural areas, but also in urban areas. Its missions are to: 

- provide technical advices to contracting authorities; 

- participate to information transfer (training courses, field visits); 

- experiment solutions against streaming and erosion; 

- study the hydrological state of the different catchment basins of the region; 

- study the composition of the streaming waters. The AREAS works in the entire region of Haute-Normandie, which is composed of two departments: Seine-Maritime and Eure. Seine-Maritime is the most concerned department as concerns streaming and erosion, and is also the most productive agricultural area in France, due to the depth of the silt in its soils (5 to 10 meters). Violent floods in December 1999 and 2000 have mobilized the population of the department; as a consequence, catchment basins organisations have been created. According to the AREAS, catchment basins are indeed the relevant local territories for working on streaming and erosion. In order to determine the territory where the patrimonial audit will be led, these few criteria were established. In the ideal case, the local territory would: 

- already have scientific soils data (soils composition, axes of streaming...), because of the     research approach of the SAS-STRAT project; 

- present a history of soil management; 

- if possible present a dairy production (in order to compare with the Dutch case study); 

(^4) [http://www.areas.asso.fr](http://www.areas.asso.fr) 


- be interested in following the process of the patrimonial audit; The process of the patrimonial audit requires a partner that formally commissions the patrimonial audit. This partner could be the AREAS, or an Association of catchment basin, or both of them. During the meeting with Mr Ouvry, it has been decided to work with an Association of catchment basin based in Seine-Maritime (where the problematic of streaming is more important than in Eure), and to work on the global problematic of the impacts of streaming, of drinking water cloudiness, flood risks and pollutions by phytosanitary products, and not only the problematic of soils fertility loss (because this problematic is not so important for farmers, who have for most of them very deep and rich soils). So in first approach, the strategic issue on which the patrimonial audit would focus seemed to be: _At which conditions farmers, who are not so much concerned by the loss of their soil fertility, can do something against streaming, because other stakeholders (like elected representatives) live problems?_ Mr Ouvry proposed to work on the catchment basin of the rivers “Austreberthe” and “Saffimbec”, because the President of the Association of catchment basin is someone very interested in these issues, and because this Association is actively involved in these issues. As a consequence, the research team decided to lead the patrimonial audit on this local territory, provided that this choice would be validated by Mr Cortinovis, President of the SMBVAS, the Association of catchment basin of the Austreberthe and the Saffimbec (“Syndicat Mixte de Bassin Versant de l’Austreberthe et du Saffimbec” 5 ). During this meeting with Mr Ouvry, the research team also established the list of the “macro- stakeholders”, i.e. the stakeholders having responsibilities linked to the considered issue at the level of the whole considered territory (approximately 10 people), that were to be interviewed during the patrimonial audit. This list would then be validated and completed with the SMBVAS (see list of interviewees in Annex 5). **6.4.4.3 Final agreement on the method and the list of interviewees with the President and**     **coordinator of the SMBVAS** The research team has contacted Mr Cortinovis, who proposed us to meet with Ms Bouzid, coordinator of the SMBVAS, on Tuesday 18 th^ September 2012. The SMBVAS was created in 2000, and has for goal to make the different local authorities of the basin (upstream and downstream) work together on floods issue. This meeting was the occasion to: 

- Explain to Mr Cortinovis and Ms Bouzid the concepts and methodology that will be used in the     SAS-STRAT project (in particular the patrimonial audit) 

- Validate the intervention on the territory of the SMBVAS 

- Determine the title of the patrimonial audit, i.e. the strategic question that will be asked to each     interviewed people. The definitive title decided with the SMBVAS is: **“Conditions and means of**     **the improvement of the management of soils quality on the territory of the catchment basin**     **of Austreberthe and Saffimbec”** 

- Complete and validate the list of “macro-stakeholders” 

- Determine the list of the “micro-stakeholders”, i.e. local stakeholders (approximately 20 people –     see list of interviewees in Annex 5). On this point, the SAS-STRAT French team had precise     requirement about the stakeholders to interview (farmers, local authorities representatives,     associations of victims of floods, associations of hunters, ecological associations), and the     SMBVAS found the correspondent contacts. 

- Agree about the next steps: a mail sent to people to interview and then, a call to make an     appointment with them.

**6.4.4.4 Signature of the patrimonial audit contract** According to the patrimonial audit method, there is always a contract between the team of patrimonial auditors and the sleeping partner of the patrimonial audit. In this case, it has been decided with the AREAS and the SMBVAS to establish a contract between the team of auditors and both of the AREAS and the SMBVAS. This contract has been signed during the interviews of Mr Cortinovis and Mr Ouvry (cf. contract in Annex 4 ). **6.4.4.5 Meetings with the stakeholders and report** During the meeting with Mr. Cortinovis and Ms. Bouzid on Tuesday 18 th^ September 2012, we have validated the idea to send a mail to people we have to interview and then, to call them to fix an appointment. Thanks to the mail and the phone calls, we have begun to organise a meeting with each stakeholder. Thus, between 17 th^ September 2012 and 23 rd^ January 2013, **thirty-six people have been interviewed** according to the IDPA grid, over thirty interviews. The research team has begun to organise meetings with each stakeholders. The information collected during the interviews has been processed according to the parts and subparts of the IDPA grid. All the interviewed stakeholders had been invited to a meeting for an oral presentation of the results by the researchers, which took place on Monday 18 th^ March 2013 in Normandy. Eighteen people were present. **6.4.4.6 Bibliography** 

##### The research team has built a bibliography for the case study. This bibliography is given in Annex 5. 

**6.4.4.7 Organisation of the SAS-STRAT project meeting in Normandy** The research team responsible for the French case study prepared the 2 nd^ SAS-STRAT research meeting in Normandy (24 th^ 26 th^ October, Barentin). The aim of this meeting was in particular to present the first results of the patrimonial audit to the AREAS and the SMBVAS and to the whole SASSTRAT research team. 

#### 6.4.5 Results obtained 

**6.4.5.1 Securing the process of intervention research** After identifying the precise territory and issue on which the French case study is focusing, we have set up the coordination framework with the stakeholders concerned by the case study, including signature of a patrimonial audit contract with the AREAS and the SMBVAS and identification of the list of stakeholders to be interviewed. **6.4.5.2 Mains results** 6.4.5.2.1 Identification of the situation, concerned stakeholders and problems The first question asked to the interviewed stakeholders during the patrimonial audit aimed to see what “dimensions” or “qualities” they associate to the management of soil quality. The first reality showed by the interviews of the stakeholders is the fact that most of the soils are loamy soils, a composition promoting slaking, and by this way considerably accelerating the process of runoff. But other aspects of “soil quality” emerge. The stakeholders describe soils in terms of **surface** , **profile** , as a **filter** , an **interface** between the outside and the bedrock and as a **moving material**. The patrimonial audit also reveals five different categories of stakeholders, which one having a different relationship to soils. These five categories of stakeholders are: 

- the local elected representatives 

- the farmers 

- the representatives of national, regional and departmental administrations 

- the associations 


- the experts and scientists For all of them, soils is a wealth for the territory but it is subject to trends of degradation: industrialization of agriculture, increasing urbanisation. These threats take place at all levels: global (markets), Europe & State (policies), watershed (water management), landscape mosaic, farms & agricultural parcels A key problem identified is the consequences of horizontal as vertical soil movements (runoffs, soil erosion, flooding and mudslides, impacts on water quality). On other aspects, interviewed stakeholders identify rather emerging tensions than acute problems: loss of soil productivity due to erosion (but is it a problem for farmers?); artificialisation of land; soils plays less their role of filter (ploughing of grasslands); the loss of “the identity of Normandy”. **So, the strategic core of the issue is: can the farming world and society meet in a global management of the territory and of soil quality as a global & regional common resource?** 6.4.5.2.2 Diagnosis of the current system of action Flooding, runoff, become a concern and a major issue for public authorities in Normandy in the 1980s. In 1990, following extensive erosion and, the Prefect demands the creation of watersheds associations for all the Seine-Maritime, including the SMBVAS (Syndicat Mixte du Bassin Versant de l’Austreberthe et du Saffimbec) partner of this research-intervention. The SMBVAS as a key role in the struggle against runoffs. But, it is seen as treating the symptom rather than the cause of problems and action of SMBVAS on the symptoms make them less visible. Soils are also a key issue for local players, which translate into a myriad of activities. Non-farm people find some awareness among farmers, they receive some individual efforts. But they also find that “these actions are struggling to have a “system effect”, a “global effect” on the erosion and runoff” and for farmers, a better management of soil quality is difficult to consider under current conditions. It’s difficult for them to reconcile dominant economic logic and management of soil. Overall, **actors of “intermediate territorial level” seem more pro-active but they struggle to mobilise other levels (individual, national, European level).** So, interviewees noted a multitude of actions, but non-complex actions in response to a multi- stakeholders and complex problem. Soil quality issues are addressed in a non-complex way, which generates various negative systemic effects (for example, individually, with fewer inputs, a farmer is likely to receive “double penalty”: less yields and a lower price for his crop). **For actors, those systemic effects discredit or will eventually discredit the decision-­‐making process and those who have taken the initiative.** Interviewees also felt that the system of action is at a pivotal moment: with **the desire to move from risk reduction towards prevention,** and, for actors met, there will be no sustainable improvement of runoff management without managing all dimensions related to soils even if they confirm that there is no comprehensive and concerted approach to soil quality. So, there is a lack of capacity to act as a whole, and it’s becoming prejudicial for action. This is even more true that many actors agree on the fact that there is a satisfactory level of knowledge of these phenomena (including a scientific point of view) and range of actions to implement, but neither the “whole voluntary" nor the “whole regulation” or the “whole economic” seem satisfactory. So, in partial conclusion of the “diagnosis section”, the “soil quality” remains a “weak signal” difficult to integrate into the daily practices of each institution, public or private, of each individual. However, because of the “circulating nature” of the phenomena, their “transappropriativity” (i.e. the fact that they cross the usual categories of public and private appropriation, like private property, public mandates...), the accumulation of "micro-decisions" (i.e. decisions of individual actors in the framework of their own activity) is causing “macro-phenomena”. Changing these “micro-decisions”, requires for each actor to implement “burdensome strategies”, in a context where many actions are carried out but without any real shared strategy at the basin level. So, **we find an asymmetry between the importance of issues related to runoff and weak signals perceived by each actor.** 6.4.5.2.3 Prospect: evolution of the situation, problems and response To take a positive step, it seems necessary to reconcile different spatial horizons (as “territorial” horizon and “sectorial” horizon (market, economic sectors...), also local / national / European and 


global levels) and different temporal horizons (crisis management, longer time of great changes in agriculture & urbanisation, time of democracy & institutions...). According to the stakeholders the **probable scenario** is that current trends (industrialisation of agriculture, urbanisation) will persist. For some actors, this leads to tougher regulations, competition on land and land degradation, and on the issue of runoff and flooding, a good level of management. The **negative scenario** is for the territory the occurrence of a big flood, pollution affecting water quality, decrease of agricultural activity, loss of soil fertility. For erosion control, the negative scenario is for the stakeholders to go further without leaving the “only volunteers” or “everything regulated” logics. But, acting only with volunteers raises questions of efficiency; acting only with regulations leads to anticipation by stakeholders of non-productive effects, so these stakeholders dissociate from the action, the risk of destabilization of institutions and the break of the trust between stakeholders, who act more and more in an administrative way. The **positive scenario** is unclear for stakeholders but they insist on a strong change in farming practices (not based on coercion) with better environmental impact and still economically viable farms and innovative urbanisation that integrates further storm water management. In terms of action, the prospect reveals the stake that consists in answering that question: do the stakeholders wait for the next flood to take the positive step they speak about, or do they create an innovative and positive project out of crisis? 6.4.5.2.4 Modes of soil quality management to set up according to the stakeholders The interviewed actors describe a desirable management mode that is not clearly defined but some characteristics are sketched out: defining with all the parties involved what is expected for soil, at the territory level; acting simultaneously at different levels; a new role for elected representatives (facilitator of the engagement of multiple private owners alongside public authorities, for better coordinated management of water and soil) Those requirements are then translated into priority axes. Firstly, protect soil, in term of quantity, (prevent the artificialisation of lands...) but also in term of quality (redevelop a more suitable agronomy). Secondly, act together rather than wait for enormous efforts of the few or focussing on few issues. Finally, do not forget the major technical measures as maintenance of structures, floodplains, etc. 6.4.5.2.5 Key lessons from the French case study Problems related to the improvement of soil quality can be classified in three categories: 

- The mono-stakeholder problems, considered as non-complex problems (e.g. agricultural     practices of each farmer), the conventional ways reach limits in influencing individual actors. 

- The bi- or oligo-stakeholders problems, where the reduction of complexity is negotiated (e.g.     construction of hydraulic & retaining structures by SMBVAS). This approach is necessary but     also limited, because understanding of quality is not appropriated by all actors. 

- The inherently complex and multi-stakeholders problems (important number of stakeholders,     dealing with complex issues – e.g. management of the causes of runoffs). Complex and multi-     stakeholders action does not exist... but could exist. This requires the establishment of forum,     languages, know-how for meeting, to meet, communicate and negotiate. In the case studied,     such places do not exist; they are latent but not actual. **In terms of recommendations, public soil quality policies (notably a possible European Directive on soil quality) can simultaneously achieve three major requirements.** First, it is obvious that such public policies should include global norms, universal standards, but it is clear from this work that it should not stop here. Secondly, and paradoxically, these policies as an “external driver” could contribute to the emergence of “self-organized” communities of actors in the territories; these communities would manage soil quality. What conditions can allow the emergence of such communities? At the European level, a Soil Directive may facilitate to identify these communities, their practices and know-how... and also their limitations. Rather than imposing soil qualities from outside, it can enhance the ability of actors in rural territories to define "soil qualities" they wish to manage. It could strengthen the capacity of these communities, by helping them to invest in “facilitation functions”. Finally, soil quality policies should enable the meeting between these two modes of knowledge and action, which are complementary. It could strengthen these communities to be open to 


outside concerns to manage “Soil Quality” as a global and regional common good (and not only a local common good). But it can also contribute to fostering local applicability of global public policy on soil. 


### 6.5 WP5: Case study: Belgium 

#### 6.5.1 Objectives 

WP5 team addresses the issue of soil quality through the analysis of farmers' transition to conservation agriculture in the Walloon region (Belgium). Through a micro-historical analysis of individual and collective transition pathways, the research seeks to understand how new practices around conservation agriculture can address the issue of soil quality management and open new opportunities for soil quality management for farmers, local public authority/residents and regional policy. This research contributes to several issues addressed by the SAS-STRAT project in: 

- analyzing the different soil qualities identified and experienced by the different stakeholders; 

- analyzing the conditions for an integration between conservation agriculture and cultivated soil     conservation challenges; 

- analyzing the successes and failures of the regional approaches for integrated management     of cultivated soil qualities and functions. 

#### 6.5.2 Context of the case study 

Conservation agriculture is an agricultural model that aims to maintain soil fertility and prevent soil erosion through the application of principles such as minimal soil disturbance (reduced tillage), permanent soil cover and crop rotation. For farmers, reduced tillage techniques are first a solution for technical or economic problems: they permit the cultivation of very stony or clayey soil and they allow fuel and labour saving. Simultaneously, conservation agriculture meets current societal and political concerns about soil quality: its abilities to maintain soil fertility and prevent soil erosion allow conservation agriculture to be considered as a tool for the preservation of soil quality. The Belgian case study focuses on transition pathways of soil management in the new context of individual and collective and public policies developing “conservation agriculture” (CA). The case is addressed through a multi-level transition perspective that focuses the analysis on Greenotec ASBL (non-for-profit association) in Belgium. Greenotec is the only association in the Walloon region leading the transition towards zero tillage. It has settled experimental platforms and a frame of extension. Greenotec has built a network of more than 200 farmers that are on the pathway of conservation agriculture transition. More recently, Greenotec has set up contract with local municipalities that are confronted with mud floods to connect floods issue with cropping practices. Greenotec has also a tradition of cooperation with researchers but not yet with socio-economist scientists. In the Walloon region (South of Belgium), our investigation area, several farmers experienced reduced tillage in the early 1980's. Since then, conservation agriculture has expanded and, nowadays, the Walloon agricultural surface under reduced tillage is estimated to be between 15 and 20% for winter wheat crops and less than 10% for other crops (Greenotec 2012). Reduced tillage techniques are developing mainly in Hesbaye (crops region) and in the Condroz (mixted region).

#### 6.5.3 Method for the case study 

Among the various schools of thought emerging from the « _Sustainability Transition Studies_ », we are positioning our analysis within the multi-level perspective set out by Geels (2002) and Geels and Schot (2007). Here, transitional processes are interpreted as being the dynamics of inter-action between the three analytical levels defined by Geels and Schot (2007) as follows: _1) Niches of innovation_ : spaces where radical new approaches emerge to then mature and progress while remaining more or less protected from the pressure of selection exerted by the _regime_. _2) Socio-technical regimes_ : sets of norms, standards, beliefs, regulations, and cognitive routines, which direct the trajectories of practices within a given sphere. The stability of a _regime_ is founded on the strong inter-dependence of these various components. This engenders a degree of irreversibility making the _regime_ more or less resistant to change. 3) _Socio-technical landscape_ : the environment considered to be exogenous in relation to the _regime._ It encompasses macro-economies, large-scale models of cultural representations, and macro-political trends and developments. Within the context of our analysis, ploughing is considered to be one of the components of the _regime_ of modern-day agricultural production. As emphasized by Goulet and Vinck, ploughing can be considered an institution insofar as it is both an externalized normative framework (i.e. is beyond the control of individuals) and one internalized by individuals, which directs the trajectory of farming practices. Farmer’s connection with plowing is a robust one. Working the land in this way remains a practice deeply anchored in the professional norms of farmers and in the recommendations of prescriber organizations (Chambers of Agriculture, cooperatives). [...] It is so embedded in beliefs and conventions, partly upheld by legal frameworks and standardized operational 


procedures, that one can legitimately speak of plowing as an institution 6 (Goulet and Vinck 2012 , 205 ). On the basis of this observation, we posit that conservation agriculture in the Walloon region of Belgium is an emergent _niche_ of innovation marking a break with ploughing – an institution of the _regime_ of conventional agriculture 7. The emergence of this _niche_ is facilitated by several components of the _socio-technical landscape_ that are bringing pressure to bear on the agricultural _regime_. These include the energy crises that focused attention on the costs of ploughing (fuel), the liberalization of agricultural markets that raised the problem of European agriculture competitiveness and of climaterelated concerns, the issue of soil quality management now high on the political agenda (draft European framework directive on soil protection), the recognition of conservation agriculture by the FAO, as well as the more far-reaching issues of sustainable development associated with the evolution of the CAP. Some of the criticisms levelled at the _Sustainability Transition Studies_ (Shove _et al._ 2010, Smith _et al._ 2005, Berkhout _et al._ 2004) point at the difficulty of this theoretical corpus being able to characterize the way in which the development of a radical innovation within a _niche_ can affect a _regime_. To describe the process whereby links between the _niche_ and the _regime_ can be created, Grin and van Staveren (2007) proposed the notion of _anchoring_ according to which _niche_ experimentation becomes anchored in the _regime_. We demonstrated how the case of conservation agriculture inverts this notion of _anchoring_ and how the notion of _insularization_ is more appropriated to describe the relations between _niche_ and _regime_. Contrary to the process of _anchoring_ , the founding principle of conservation agriculture is disengagement, a shift away from what has historically constituted an absolute must for the modernization of agriculture, i.e. ploughing. In connection with this, Goulet and Vinck (2012) developed the concept of _innovation by removal_^8 , placing at the heart of the transitional process towards conservation agriculture the analysis of mechanisms of detachment from the institution that is ploughing. Through our analysis, we will be positioning innovation by removal within a process that we have qualified as insularization in relation to the dominant agricultural regime. The notion of insularization arose from a twofold observation. Firstly, conservation agriculture is a niche that seems to emerge within the regime of conventional agriculture and not on its fringe. Secondly, farmers’ trajectories show that the mechanism whereby farmers detach from ploughing can extend to other dimensions of agricultural practices. This process of insularization thus stems from sociotechnical transformations associated with transitional detachment from the regime of conventional agriculture which opens up new spheres of learning and practices – the island detaching itself from the continent – while drawing some of its normative techniques and models from conventional agriculture 

- the continent. The point that interests us here is not the result of the insularization process but well the mechanisms through which conservation agriculture is built up as a niche in relation to the dominant agricultural regime. We will evidence how different practices of reduced tillage imply diverse reconfiguration in farmers' practices and representations systems. These transformations might be superficial or systemic, they might affect a part or the entire system. Following our multi-level analytical framework, we have conducted our fieldwork investigations on five levels: 1 on farmers' practices and trajectories : through farmers' interviews and farm observations, we try     to understand individual transitions ; 

(^6) Original citation : « ...le lien qui attache l’agriculteur au labour est robuste ; en effet, le labour constitue une pratique encore profondément ancrée dans les normes professionnelles des agriculteurs et dans les recommandations des organismes prescripteurs (Chambres d’agriculture, coopératives). [...] Il est alors légitime de parler du labour comme d’une institution [...] une prégnance de croyances et de conventions, soutenues en partie par des cadres juridiques et par des procédures opérationnelles standardisées » (Goulet and Vinck 2012, 205). (^7) It is to be noted here that our hypothesis pertains to the specific case of conservation agriculture in the Walloon Region. In other contexts, the development of conservation agriculture is or has been such that it cannot in fact be considered as a _niche_ marking a break with the dominant agricultural _regime._ (^8) In French: « innovation par retrait » 


2 on collective learning processes : through observation during field trips, workshops and seminars organised around conservation agriculture, we address the issue of learning and of the articulation between individual transition and a collective model of transition ; 3 on Greenotec activities : through observation of Greenotec meetings and activities and interviews with the leaders of the association, we aim to understand how is built a collective model around conservation agriculture ; 4 on Walloon institutions related to soil management and conservation agriculture : through the investigation of different departments of the public administration, GISER (in charge of integrated soil, flooding and erosion management) and NITRAWAL (in charge of nitrate pollution prevention), we reach to understand the role played by the public institutions and their articulation with conservation agriculture ; 5 on research centres related to soil management and conservation agriculture : through semistructured interviews with scientists, we reached to understand the role played by scientific research in soil quality management and conservation agriculture. The initial step in field investigation was to set up a collaboration framework with Greenotec, identified as being a central actor in conservation agriculture in the Walloon region. We first met Greenotec president and coordinator to present the SAS-STRAT project and to establish a convention of collaboration (see Annex 1). Our project was welcomed by Greenotec and later, the convention has been accepted by the steering committee of the association. Between September 2012 and September 2013, we conducted semi-structured interviews and participants’ observations with the identified stakeholders, and in March 2013 we organized a multistakeholder seminar within the SAS-STRAT. The seminar and the field trip offered the possibility for all these different people to meet and exchange around conservation agriculture and soil quality. For us, it offered a wealth of lessons learnt, opportunity and data collection for our understanding of the transition process to conservation agriculture and its articulation with soil conservation issues. 

#### 6.5.4 Work process 

**6.5.4.1 Theoretical framework** ULg has refined the theoretical framework set up previously for the case study. The coupling of the multi-level perspective of « Sustainability Transition Studies » with the concept of “innovation by removal” (“innovation par retrait”) developed by Goulet et Vinck (2012) led us to develop the metaphor of “insularization” to characterize the process of transition to conservation agriculture and highlight its specificities: 1) conservation agriculture is a niche of innovation that emerges from within the conventional agricultural model through the removal of ploughing, 2) it is both a process of detachment from mainstream agriculture that generates new spaces for learning and innovation, and a process of new attachments to the regime. The metaphor of the insularization addresses the question of the relationship between niches and regime by inverting to notion of “anchoring” (see the abstract of two submitted paper – annex 6 and 7). **6.5.4.2 Setting up a cooperation framework with Greenotec for the empirical field work** ULg has met Greenotec president and coordinator to set up collaboration with the association in conducting fieldwork and has established a collaboration convention with Greenotec (see Annex 8): the convention was accepted by the board of the association). **6.5.4.3 Empirical field work (in progress)** ULg has attended meetings of the board of Greenotec and has attended two field days organized by Greenotec for the farmers: 

- a trip in the Pas-de-Calais region to visit two farmers engaged in no-tillage techniques (this     constituted a first opportunity to meeting several farmers involved in Conservation Agriculture and     to present the research carried out in the cases study) 

- a visit of a farm engaged in Direct Seeding in the Belgian Walloon region (this farm is the only one     using such techniques in the region). 


A student, Prisca Sallets, carried out her master thesis research under the supervision of Pierre Stassart on farmers' transition to conservation agriculture in the Walloon region. She conducted interviews and observations with 5 farmers. The full transcription of these interviews and observations were used as a basis for building the first analytical orientations of the Belgian case study. Between September 2012 and September 2013 , semi-structured interviews were conducted with: 1) 11 farmers 2) 3 persons from the public administration (SPW DGO 3 ) 3) 3 scientists 4) 2 Greenotec coordinators (the former and the current one Participant observations were conducted in several places and events: 

- 2 meetings of Greenotec steering board 

- 2 annual meetings of Greenotec steering committee in the public administration 

- 1 field trip: a field visit of Greenotec experimentation on rape cultivation and associated cover     crops. **6.5.4.4 Organization of a multi-stakeholders workshop** We organized in March 2013 a multi-stakeholder seminar within the SAS-STRAT project (see the program in annex 8). The seminar gathered 6 people from the SAS-STRAT team, 2 soil scientists from Wagening University (to perform the VSA), 6 people from the Walloon public administration, two scientific researchers, the coordinator of Greenotec and two farmers. In the morning, we had presentation of Maxime Merchier from Greenotec and of Esther Goidts from the SPW(DGO3). Then we presented the intermediate results of our research. In the afternoon, a field was organized in a farm. Two different methods of soil assessment were presented: a root scoring (by Greenotec) and a Visual Soil Assessment (see Dutch case). We had the opportunity to compare a soil profile in a field in reduced tillage and in a plowed field. The seminar and the field trip offered the possibility for all these different people to meet and exchange around conservation agriculture and soil quality. For us, it offered a wealth of lessons, opportunity and data collection for our understanding of the transition process to conservation agriculture and its articulation with soil conservation issues. **6.5.4.5 Data analysis and redaction of the final report** During this period, interviews and other data were analysed in order to address the issue of the transition to conservation agriculture and of soil quality management. The participation to several congresses and the writing of two papers help to refine the analysis and the results. Meanwhile, ULg wrote its contribution to the SAS-STRAT final report as well as the report for the Walloon administration (in French). **6.5.4.6 Restitution conference at the Walloon Public Service (DGO3)** In September 2013, we were invited by Esther Goidts from the Walloon Public Service to give a conference on the results of our research (see annex 9). 25 persons attended the conference, mainly from the administration but also from research centres. The discussion with the participants after the conference was an opportunity for us to refine the conclusion of our analysis. 

#### 6.5.5 Results obtained 

The analysis of farmers’ transition to conservation agricultural evidences the following sequential process: 1) destabilization of the regime, 2) learning and experimentation, 3) radical change in the understanding of soil, 4) transformation of cover crops functions as well as fertilization principles, pesticides use, vision of agriculture, etc. The way the regime is destabilized is case-dependent: observed farmers have entered a process of learning and experimentation of no-till or reduced tillage techniques for a variety of reasons: technical 


problems (soil compaction, difficulties to plough), a need to save time and workforce (e.g. one farmer working on a surface of several hundred hectares), a wish to save money (e.g. by lowering fuel use), soil erosion problems... The study showed that the transformation of soil conception (from a “soil as a substrate” to a “living soil”) is a tipping-point in the transition process because of its implications in terms of irreversibility and sustainability in the transition. For farmers who have developed a holistic and functional conception of soil quality, soil quality is no longer considered only a matter of soil structure that can be achieved through adapted techniques: it becomes a matter of preserving and improving living organisms and processes in the soil through diversified practices. One of these practices is the requalification of some principles of fertilization: some farmers reduce their fertilizer use since they increase organic matter rates, especially with cover crops and by interfering with the soil as little as possible, and continuously. This practice is associated with the practice of diversified cover crops: the role of nitrogen-fixing intermediate crops can be extended by assigning numerous other functions to them, and particularly soil organisms feeding and soil decompaction. The intensive use of pesticides can also be called into question by farmers regarding their potentially negative impact on soil life and biodiversity. Finally, the transition to conservation agriculture can lead farmers to consider other alternative models such as organic farming and integrated pest management that might nourish their conservation agriculture practices with other sustainable techniques and representations. Regarding all these potential transformations, we can say that the switch from a “soil as a substrate” to a “living soil” increases the irreversibility of the transition: while reduced tillage in its technical dimension is quite easily reversible, the “living soil” conception induces a reconfiguration of the whole cultivation system and its foundations. Consequently, farmers implement farming practices which allow sustainable soil management but also a broader agroecological farming system within the conventional agricultural system. This transition leads not only to adaptive changes at the fringe of the system: it induces a deep and systemic transformation of conventional agricultural practices. In order to preserve the living processes in the soil, farmers might reduce their use of fertilizers (thanks to the increase of organic matter in their soil, a consequence of no-tillage), of pesticides and herbicides (by the means of “low-volume pulverisation”, resistant varieties or better observations of parasites and diseases). Usually, we can also observe the transformation of the function of cover crops. Cover crops are obligatory by the law to prevent nitrate surplus. In CA, they become a way to provide organic matter to improve soil fertility. As evidence in this research, for most of the farmers, soil degradation issue doesn’t precede the transition to conservation agriculture: it arises from the transformation of their practices and from a learning and experimentation process. The transition to conservation agriculture plays therefore a crucial role in soil quality management as it allows to the emergence of soil quality concerns among farmers. 


### 6.6 WP6: Case study: Netherlands 

#### 6.6.1 Objectives 

The objective of this work package is to conduct a case study in the Netherlands to analyse: 

- the different soil qualities as identified and experienced by researchers and stakeholders 

- challenges for improving soil quality in relation to dairy farming in the Netherlands 

- hindrances and positive factors in initiatives to integrate different soil functions and values, for     soils concerned by dairy farming 

- integrated approach on sustainable soil management (many years of experience on this field will     be gathered and brought together in this project) 

- improving organic mater by determining best farmer practices within the same soil type 

- new impulses for sustainable soil management through “eco system services” and initiatives from     dairy companies In the course of this case study, the research team invites stakeholders (e.g. farmers, experts, local and central administration, NGOs, industry and several dairy companies) to analyse their situation, and the issues of total soil quality, and will identify among them prospective Dutch participants for the integration workshop. 

#### 6.6.2 Context of the case study 

**6.6.2.1 National context** Because of its size and density, the Netherlands has considered soil as a key element of policy making quite early, notably in the environmental field. A soil protection act was voted in 1986, and several other regulations were passed since then. This regulation aims at preventing and managing in the first place soil pollution and contamination. Erosion and surface runoff are other important threats to soil in the Netherlands, and led to different policy developments, notably to prevent the side effects of the development of a more intensive agriculture from the 1970s. While Dutch regulation has set limits to different soil pollutants including from farming, initiatives were taken at the level of provinces, notably by farmers’ organisations, to self regulate. Pilot actions were also carried out in local farms to reach environmental goals through other ways than the ones prescribed by central government (Sonneveld A.P.W. et al, A Whole Farm Strategy to reduce Environmental Impacts of Nitrogen, in Journal of Environmental Quality, vol. 37, January-February 2008). These experiences have shown the limits of segmented regulation at central or local level to integrate the different dimensions of soil quality, and the value of innovation at local level in this respect, building on farmers’ knowledge of their land and soil, as well as on connections between farmers and other stakeholders (local and central administration, industry, researchers, policy makers...). Lessons can be learnt from current experiences at local level notably to understand their capacity to produce a better integration in practice of total soil quality, including the different uses and functions of soil (farming being only one of them). **6.6.2.2 Case study in the Beemster polder** The Dutch case study focuses on new impulses to increase sustainability of dairy farming in the Beemster polder, with special attention to sustainable soil management of the underlying grassland and arable lands. The polder ‘the Beemster’ is located in the province of North Holland. It was dried during the period 1609 through 1612 and is included in the UNESCO World Heritage sites (see historical map of the area below). The typical squared shape of the parcels and the grid of canals paralleling the grid of roads, which have been preserved intact, is one of the reasons that it is listed as a world heritage. 


Figure 2 – historical map of the polder “the Beemster” CONO dairy farmers cooperative (www.cono.nl) has a factory in the polder since early 1900, which notably produces the Beemster cheese. In 2006 they adapted the sustainability program of Ben&Jerry’s ice-cream company. Within the program of Ben&Jerry’s, sustainable dairy farming was described as ‘happy people, happy cow and happy planet’. In December 2010 CONO launched an integral score for the ‘happy planet’. All 550 farmers that deliver their milk to CONO have been scored on nitrogen (N), phosphate (P) and carbon (C) on the nutrient balances. Although only 30% of the CONO farmers are located in the Beemster, CONO can be seen as an innovative case. CONO is leading in sustainable dairy production in the Netherlands. Since then, they have also been looking for a better and more farmer friendly method of scoring soil quality. The main characteristic of the new system was that it uses a visual method for scoring soil quality. With the visual method, farmers get better knowledge of their soil, and CONO is willing to reward them when they achieve better scores on ‘happy planet’. In the Beemster area soil consist mainly of clay soils. Often the land is used for shortterm profit crops like bulbs or tulips. These crops gain a lot of cash in one year but are devastating for soil quality. “Ben & Jerry’s” ice-cream company and CONO use a score for environmental impact of dairy production (developed by Frank Verhoeven) to underpin their sustainability program Caring Dairy. This score is now tested within a broad group of participating dairy farmers. The criteria for scoring sustainability are in debate at the moment, but a general agreement was made between stakeholders, government and scientists. Several instruments where brought together in one score for “happy planet” (air quality, Water quality, Soil quality, Impact on climate change, Biodiversity and Footprint) The data needed for this score can also be used for a certificate and good results can be rewarded in a way that dairy farmers are stimulated to lower levels of nitrogen and phosphate surpluses and improve their soil quality. The province of Drenthe and Utrecht are using the score and searching for new ways of stimulating soil quality by measuring “farmers data” and rewarding “best practices”. 

#### 6.6.3 Method for the case study 

The case study takes the form of qualitative and technical research in the form of interviews and data collection of 25 to 30 individuals on the basis of the methodology defined in WP3.The case study focuses on the territory of the Beemster polder, while taking into account the relations to province and central government, and experts. This case study is carried out under the form of interviews and expert meetings with farmers and relevant stakeholders (see before). Data analysis is carried out and several examples and best practices are written down and discussed. In the end, a description of sustainable soil management in relation to dairy farming is given, a list of measurements, potential scores (range of results) and the potential use for government regulation and/or ecosystem services is to be written down. Five dairy farmers were selected as ‘best practice’ farmers and compared with five conventional dairy farmers. From these ten farmers the questionnaire (see annex 9) is taken. To measure the quality of the soil belonging to the dairy farms, it is important to look at the Organic Matter (OM) content of the soil as one of the key-indicators. Research done by Sonneveld et al. (2008) showed that within the exact same type of soil (in theory), OM content differed by more than 4% due to differences in management of the farmer (in practice). Factors like the amount of applied fertilizer, the quality of the organic manure, land use, ploughing, water management, etc. affect the quality of 


the soil throughout the years. An optimal OM content is needed to lower inputs and to improve the amount and quality of the grasslands and fodder crops on a long term. In the used "cycle approach" the aim is to improve the quality of the soil, the crops (mainly grasslands), storage of the harvested feed and the manure quality. As a result farmers can successfully lower their inputs of concentrates and their use of artificial fertilizer. Farmers’ knowledge combined with scientific knowledge is effectively used to improve the nutrient cycle (efficiency) on dairy farms. In order to assess the quality of soils – including OM content – with the farmers, Dr. ir. Marthijn Sonneveld (Wageningen University, chair of land evaluation) has introduced the VSA score within CONO/Beemster. This score is an easy to access and cheap tool to evaluate integrated sustainable soil management in productive agriculture (grasslands and arable land). The tool was invented in New Zealand (Sheppard) and worked out for the FAO. For the CONO cheese factory the method seems to be a attractive way to address sustainable soil-and land management, for building more learning capacity of the farmers and even for rewarding more sustainable soil management use of their farmers (on the long term). The VSA score helps to: 

- Stimulate the discussion about sustainable soil management among the stakeholders (on the     spot). 

- Involve other stakeholders (society, governments, civilians) by scoring sustainable soil     management 

- Make sustainable soil management accountable 

#### 6.6.4 Results obtained 

**6.6.4.1 Development of the Visual Soil Assessment scoring method used in the framework of the Dutch case study** The objective of a Visual Soil Assessment (VSA) is to give a grade to the soil by watching and feeling it. A good soil quality is very important for the sustainability of a land (high yield and no reduction of the soil quality). Different soil properties (e.g. soil structure, rooting pattern) reflect the soil conditions as result of the land management. By carrying out the VSA, a score on farm scale will be given based on scores of those soil properties. The higher the score is, the better the soil quality is. Why VSA? Land managers need a reliable, quick and easy tool to assess the soil quality. They can do the assessment by themselves, just by looking to the soil and give a score to the soil quality indicators. Based on their VSA score, they can make the right decisions that lead to more sustainable land management. The VSA method is developed in New Zealand by Graham Shepherd and implemented by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). As example the field guide for pastureland is included in this folder. Example of VSA in the Beemster Where to carry out the assessment in the field? It is important to perform the VSA at random locations in the field. Each unique combination of soil type and land use will form a stratum, and each stratum on a farm will be assessed. For this test we used the land from a Beemster farmer, the farmers parcels are shown in Figure 3. 


Figure 3 Overview of parcels from the Beemster farmer Visual scoring At each site, a score can be given to each criterion (2 is for good conditions, 1 for moderate conditions and 0 for poor conditions). On the scorecard, weights are assigned to the criteria based on the accuracy and importance of the criterion. the VSA score for a sampling location is calculated by summing the individual scores of the criteria. In the example below, the VSA score of site number 10 of this farm is 18 out of 44. After conversation with the farmer sometimes it seems that something special happened in the parcel, for example filling up a ditch or the construction of gas pipes. Figure 4 shows the result of the VSA score that has been made on the Beemster farm during the excursion. Figure 4 Result of VSA-score card on a Beemster farm 


When the entire farm has been sampled, a final VSA score is given based on the VSA scores at site level. It is an indication for the management of the field and can be used to compare it with different farmers in the neighbourhood. The resulting VSA scores given to 10 farmers from the Beemster polder is shown in Table 1. The maximum score that can be achieved is 44.

For example: the comparison between continuous grassland and a field where maize is grown for 7 years. Graphically the VSA score can be shown in an octagram that gives a quick overview. In Figure 5 below, the octagram of the Beemster farm is shown. One can notice that grassland and maize are given separate graphs. Figure 5 Octagram of the VSA score

**6.6.4.2 Case study** The research team responsible for the Dutch case study has analysed the social network related to soil quality in the Beemster area with special focus on dairy farming and the role of co-operative CONO cheese makers. The results of this work is exposed below What are the characteristics and unique qualities of this specific soil? The Beemster region has a 400 years history that has a direct impact on its present landscape and spatial organisation: fields, farms, roads, canals, villages and towns. It also has a consequence on the actor network involved in agricultural issues (such as soil quality): for instance, the water board and the local/regional/national authorities play an important role in land management. What is the evolving social network related to this soil? The research team has carried out a mapping of the actors who, through their representatives, are involved in the management and preservation or development of this specific soil. The considered categories of actors considered are the following: 

- Elected and administrative representatives of the territory Beemster Polder (Waterschappen) 

- Soil scientists (among them members of the SNOWMAN network in the concerned country) 

- Soil-Land owners (e.g. Farmers, Nature organisations, Fondsen, Pachters) 

- Farmer organisations (LTO, Agrarische natuurvereniging Waterland en Dijken) 

- Actively involved regional citizens (e.g. Heemkunde kring) 

- Representatives of sustainability organisations (Unesco, Stiching Natuur en Milieu) 

- Policy makers at different levels (e.g. European Commission civil servants dealing with the CAP) The result of the mapping of actors carried out by the research team for the Dutch case study is summarised in Table 2 below.

Three sources of influence on soil quality management were identified in this network of actors: 

1. Economy and industry: Farmers, Feeding, bulb sector 9 , Dairy sector, CONO, breeding industries,     multinational firms (fertilizer, feed, etc.). 

2. Government: Water boards, local municipalities, provinces, national government, EU. 

(^9) Especially in this region (because of the soil quality) there are a lot of possibilities for dairy farmers to gain shortterm profit by sub renting the land for bulbs. 


3. Society, Science and Culture: World heritage rules, environmental organisations, Science,     Consumers, Citizens, Education, schools, farmer culture. **6.6.4.3 Quality of the Beemster soil** Beemster soil is particularly beloved by Beemster farmers, not only because it is their ‘main production tool’ or part of their patrimony and familial heritage, but especially for its qualities: “I think it is one of the best soils of the Netherlands” (farmer). The quality of Beemster soil is also identified as a resource by external bulb growers, whose actions affect the long-term quality of the soil. As regards fertility, the Beemster soil has a relatively high Organic Matter level (around 9-10%), certainly for two reasons: the first would be that the drying and farming of this soil ‘only’ dates back to 1612; the second would be linked to the nature of the (peat) soils surrounding the Beemster polder. These peat soils result from the natural filling of old deltas and marine marshes, between 6000 and 5000 Before Present, and still have an OM level higher than 80% (usually 89-90%). Clayey soils ‘dry well’ and have a good structure (compared to peat soils that are always very wet and less suitable for agriculture). The Beemster soil has been conserved by relatively extensive dairy farming practices (e.g. pastures). On those clayey soils, intensive cattle breeding, intensive crops (like bulbs, maize, etc.) and intensive crop rotations would result in a rapid OM (and Soil Organic Carbon - SOC) decline, a soil compaction, more water thus agricultural substances and soil run-off and therefore a growing equipment and operation costs for farmers with lower crop yields. The research team has identified three key issues related to soil quality in the Beemster case: 

- Current rules and regulations that accompany the soil on different levels (e.g. Non tillage rules) 

- Societal debate 

- Experimenting and developing innovations with the soil In the Beemster case, the sustainability programme developed by the CONO cooperative improves three types of qualities: 

- Soil quality itself 

- The quality of the relation of farmers with their soil 

- The quality of relations within the networks of actors related to soil management **6.6.4.4 The CONO cooperative** The CONO cooperative has to be understood in the global transformation of the global milk market. The liberalisation of the milk production will lead to the end of milk quota and the probability of price decrease. 

1. CONO is a competitive actor on the milk market. Therefore, it constantly has to innovate because     of the hard competition with much bigger dairy companies. According to our understanding of the     factory, CONO has a double vulnerability:     a. As a front runner, it must constantly innovate because of the concurrence, and the        competition on differentiation (and his economical added value) It ask a constant work of        actualisation     b. The brand ‘Beemster’ is ambiguous (e.g. for foreign consumers): the quality attached to        the brand is based on the reputation of the Beemster World Heritage while the strategy of        CONO is not focused on the Beemster area. We see more Beemster as an opportunity to        give some added reputation to the handcraft quality. 

2. CONO cooperative as a collective dynamic has a real ability to develop a better use of resources.     a. The collective organisation is led by the farmer board, there is a citizen advisor board...        there is a whole network of cooperation with the Wageningen University.     b. The cooperative plays a double role: on one hand, it tries to make progress in the        qualification of his cheese product and on the other hand, it tries to re-distribute the added        value along the food chain (4000 euros/dairy farmer). 


**6.6.4.5 CONO’s “Caring Dairy” programme as an example of development of cycle approaches in agriculture and soil quality management** In The Netherlands, Dairy farmers are one of the main users of the agriculture soils. Figure 6 shows a simplified picture of a dairy farming system. It makes clear how cows, manure, the land and roughage are connected. This picture (or better; the system thinking) was earlier described as a novelty by Stuiver et al. (2003) and can be seen as the start of a transition towards a more ecological and sustainable way of producing in The Netherlands. Figure 6: Simplified visualization of the dairy farm system The cycle approach is based on the optimal use of the farmers’ own resources such as pasture, fodder, soil, forage, manure and minimal use of external inputs like fertilizer and concentrates. This approach is put central by CONO cheese makers in their sustainability programme. CONO is a cooperative owned by its members (the farmers). Their sustainability programme Caring Dairy is focused on the sustainability of the whole chain from cow to cheese. In December 2010, the CONO Cycle Compass was launched as part of Caring Dairy (Calker, 2005). This allows members of CONO to be scored on sustainability aspects and constitutes a new way of scoring and rewarding for the management of the soil under the farm. The cycle approach is a symbol for optimized resources and supplies (sunlight, organic matter, minerals, labour, water, energy, landscape, experience, knowledge, etc.) and using as selective as possible external input, realizing an income over the long term and with respect for natural systems. (Hoes et al, 2010). Worldwide, the need to focus on the cycle approach is growing. In 2011, a report from the leading McKinsey & Company titled "towards the circular economy". Less input of concentrates and fertilizers and higher utilization of their own food, their own land and cow manure lead to cost savings and environmental benefits. The entrepreneur uses the resources of nature, such as manure, soil, water on his land or self-produced grass to ensure that soil fertility is maintained. It is scientifically increasingly possible (Oenema et al, 2011, Aarts et al, 2007, Dijkstra et al, 2010) to describe the cycle approach and monitor the results on the mineral balance. Ultimately, the management of the farm has a great influence on both the final soil and the leaking of nutrients into ground and surface water and on the emissions of greenhouse gases (De Boer et al, 2012). There is much variation among dairy farmers in business, craftsmanship and environmental performance in practice. The cycle approach embraces variations in the management of the business. This approach is not a set of rules and regulations such as organic agriculture. It describes a goal now and in the future with less input and a maximum output achieved with minimal losses to the environment and climate. The soil plays a key role. CONO wants targeted farmers with sustainable performance and reward good management practices. This poses the question of how the entrepreneur can have insight into sustainable soil in such a way that can also be rewarded. Business figures, such as the phosphate efficiency indicate that in the year the soil is functioning properly, but it still gives insufficient image of how sustainable is the soil management of the farmer. Besides, recycling figures for N, P and C will also include an assessment whether the farmers now and in the future enables the soil to maintain. Soil quality is not just a concept that relates to the chemical state of the soil, but also on the biological and the physical state. This makes it necessary to achieve better overall score and instruments. 


Since 2008, CONO cheese makers have developed the Caring Dairy workshop programme where the affiliated farmers can attend workshops and create action plans. With the “Cow Compass” and “Recycle Compass” scores launched in December 2010, CONO assesses the quality of farmers’ practices as regards cow health and well-being and preservation of nature and the environment. The scores in conjunction with the workshops provide the knowledge to farm in a more sustainable manner. The Recycle-Compass score of CONO is a uniform scoring method to evaluates how farms succeed in closing their production cycle. The more the circuit is closed, the lower the losses to the environment and climate, all in conjunction with an attractive landscape and biodiversity. Within the Recycle Compass the mineral balance (the supply of concentrates and fertilizer on the farm minus the discharge of milk and meat) plays an important role. Furthermore, CONO presented a strategy whereby farmers can earn additional bonuses if they have a low phosphate surplus on their business reality. CONO cheesemakers has used Recycled Compass for several years now but want to take the next step and will reward the efficient use of phosphate. This is because the world supply phosphate slowly runs out and the dairy industry will be less dependent on external inputs of phosphate, and phosphate will be more reusable. Efficient use of phosphate (by e.g. less concentrate and fertilizer imports) means in many cases economically better farmers. The farmers are also here to earn money. But the choice of reducing the phosphate surplus is also motivated by the available calculation and data collection that is reliable enough for a reward. This is in contrast to the emission of greenhouse gases that is subject to much scientific debate (e.g. on the question: how do you calculate CO2 capture it?). Every dairy farmer who is a member of CONO gets the opportunity to participate in a performance trajectory. For these participants, the mineral balance is accurately drawn. It is also a concrete improvement agreed as a P2O5 fertilizer use <8 kg P2O5/ha in 2013 and <4 kg P2O5/ha in 2015. To participate in such a process the farmer receives an additional premium of 0.0025 euros per kg milk (about 1500 euros extra on an average dairy farm). It is a redistribution of the milk, which CONO tries to create more incentives for sustainable business. Like the grazing premiums or discounts at too high a cell and count in the milk. The choice of phosphate was developed in consultation with the advisory board of the Caring Dairy program consisting of Wageningen University, the Netherlands Society for Nature and Environment, Solidaridad and WWF (see [http://www.caringdairy.nl).](http://www.caringdairy.nl).) 


### 6.7 WP7: Integration 

#### 6.7.1 Objective of the work package 

The objective of this Work Package is to develop an integration workshop (Paris, 17 th^ 18 th^ June 2013). This workshop is directed towards a pluralistic audience composed of: 

- stakeholders of the 3 case studies 

- decision-makers at national and European level concerned with soil quality management 

- soil science community The purpose of the workshop is to: 

- Share and validate in an European audience the results of the three “national” case studies     o presentation of the each case : main dimensions of soil quality involved, current functions and        threats, possible experimentation of innovative practices towards sustainable management 

- establish a shared view of the issues at stake from the three countries:     o common challenges stemming from the three cases     o common orientations or good practices stemming from the three cases 

- connect researchers and stakeholders to establish a plural network on the management of soil     quality 

- develop a shared analysis of the conditions and means of integrated soil quality with researchers     and stakeholders 

- make proposals or recommendations which can support further development of public policies and     research 

#### 6.7.2 Results 

**6.7.2.1 Integration workshop (Paris, 17-18 June 2013)** This workshop, organised in Paris on 17 th^ and 18 th^ June, gathered 21 actors from France, Belgium, the Nethelrlands and Switzerland (see list of participants in annex 17), including stakeholders from the French and Dutch case (stakeholders from the Belgian case were invited but did not come), external stakeholders from France and Switzerland, members of the SAS-STRAT Steering Committee and the SAS-STRAT research team. A system of French-Dutch simultaneous translation was made available in order to facilitate communication between stakeholders. This was appreciated by all participants for the quality and finesse of reflection and analysis that was made possible (this is a point that may seem marginal but which proved important). The programme of the seminar (see annex 16 ) was designed in order to facilitate the progressive emergence of a "common understanding" between the multiple stakeholders. This gradual process of co-expertise was developed as follows: 

- Session 1: Presentation of the results of the case studies. This session aimed to present     synthetically participants how the integrated management of agricultural soils is the context of     the 3 SAS-STRAT case studies. In order to enrich the information basis and the discussion, 2     additional cases from Switzerland and France were presented by stakeholders (as these case     studies were not developed by the SAS-STRAT research team and were not part of the     projects programme of work, they are not included in the case studies developed in this report     but are provided as in annex 18 and 19):     o France : "Supporting the transition of farmers to conservation agriculture : the experience        of the Association for Sustainable Agriculture (Association pour une Agriculture Durable –        APAD)"     o Switzerland : "Public policies for Facilitating Transition Towards Sustainable soil        management in the Swiss canton of Berne" 


- Session 2: Lessons learnt from the case studies. The second step was to introduce     participants to transversal lessons learnt from the 3 SAS-STRAT case studies. At the end of     these two sessions, first exchange between the participants enabled progressing in     formulating a common expertise on how to understand strategies for integrated management     of soil quality. This transversal analysis was developed acording to three structuring themes     (chosen by the SAS-STRAT research team):        o Sustainable soil quality management , a problem of transition in sociotechnical           systems, with self-locking effects on current practices        o Addressing complexity of soil quality        o Contribution of scientific and technical tools to soil quality management 

- Session 3 : Strategic diagnosis of the stakes and challenges for integrated soil quality     management in Europe. The principle of this session was to encourage the emergence of     shared expertise on integrated management of soil quality in the territories but also at     European level. In order to enable this, Mutadis has developed this strategic diagnosis using     the method of “patrimonial audit” (used for the French case study) with a panel of 13 actors     (see annex 20) including members of the SAS-STRAT research team, European officials     (European commission DG Research, DG Environment and Joint Research Centre) and     stakeholders from France and Switzerland. The presentation of this strategic diagnosis was     followed by a discussion with the participants of the worshop. 

- Session 4 : Recommendations - how to create conditions for actors' practices to take into     account integrated soil quality. At the end of the seminar, once the different levels of     information and lessons presented and discussed, participants' expertise was mobilized in the     form of parallel working group sessions in order to formulate recommendations that are     shared by the group for developing integrated soil quality management.     Four major issues have been proposed to guide the discussion:        o What instruments to put into debate soil quality? What instruments of qualification to           support deliberation? How to build indicators to evaluate progress with the concerned           actors in a project approach?        o How to develop situated collective learning processes? How to go from individual           advice to joint construction of soil qualification? What role of research & expertise?        o What integration forums between global stakes, sectoral priorities and the logic of           territory? How to put collectively into debate this articulation?        o How can regulatory frameworks facilitate the construction of a living organisation of           soil quality management? What contribution of each level and what type of           subsidiarity? How to facilitate the engagement and capacity of innovation (technical,           political and social) of the various actors? 


**6.7.2.2 Transversal analysis of the case studies** In SAS-STRAT, the transversal analysis of the case studies has been developed in 4 steps: 

- During the field seminars organised in the Netherlands, France and Belgium, the case study of     the country where the seminar was organised was discussed between the 3 research teams     engaged in SAS-STRAT. 

- After each seminar, short working documents were produced to summarise the analysis of the     research teams on the concerned case. 

- During the Integration workshop (Paris, 17 th^ - 18 th^ June 2013), a draft presentation of the     transversal analysis was presented and discussed with the participants 

- A final version of the draft analysis was produce and integrated into SAS-STRAT final report     (see below) The three themes that structure the cross-cutting issues were chosen by the SAS-STRAT research team during the field seminar organised in Belgium (Namur, 20 th^ - 21 st^ March 2013). 6.7.2.2.1 Sustainable soil quality management, a problem of transition in socio-technical systems: trouble within the regime and self-locking effects on current practice In this section we propose to look at what we learn from the Belgian, Dutch, and French case studies about the conditions favouring the emergence and reinforcement of dynamics of change in farmers’ practices. We shall first review briefly the general framework of transition theory, _i.e.,_ the multi-level perspective that we have developed in the Belgian case study. Then we shall see how change entails a phase of destabilising the regime and how this can lead to two types of change: ‘fit and conform’ versus ‘stretch and transform’. _a. The general framework_ Amongst the various schools of thought that have come out of Sustainability Transition Studies, we position our analysis within the multi-level perspective set out by Geels (2002) and Geels and Schot (2007). Here, transitional processes are interpreted as being the dynamics of interaction amongst the three analytical levels defined by Geels and Schot (2007) as follows: _1) Niches of innovation_ : spaces where radical new approaches emerge then to mature and progress whilst remaining more or less protected from the pressure of selection exerted by the _regime_. _2) Socio-technical regimes_ : sets of norms, standards, beliefs, regulations, and cognitive routines that direct the trajectories of practices within a given sphere. The stability of a _regime_ is founded on the strong interdependence of these various components. This engenders a degree of irreversibility that makes the _regime_ more or less resistant to change. 3) _Socio-technical landscape_ : the environment considered to be exogenous to the _regime._ It encompasses macro-economies, large-scale models of cultural representations, and macro- political trends and developments. _b. Factors that destabilise non-sustainable soil management practices?_ While the European Commission, through its official European report _“Towards a thematic strategy for soil protection (COM 206/238 final)”_ acknowledged in 2008 ‘that soil is a vital and largely non- renewable resource increasingly under pressure and that among the threats to soil are erosion, a decline in organic matter, local and diffuse contamination, sealing, compaction, a decline in biodiversity and salinization’, Member States need to raise public awareness of the importance of good soil quality and the opportunities for society’s sustainable development that good soil practices provide. Recent publications about changes in soil quality management underline in the same way that whilst it is necessary to make the science/politics interface more effective, the matter of awareness is a major factor for making such changes possible (Otte, Maring et al. 2012). As these authors point out, the invisible nature of the wealth that soils contain – and yet, the soil is the number one source of biodiversity when it comes to species – and the slowness of the processes in which soils participate make this a particularly non-interactive subject. The problem of soil quality is not a public problem today. What can be done to make this problem ‘exist’? 


Smith, Stirling and Berckhout ( 2005 ) understand regime change to be a function of two processes: (1) shifting selection pressures on the regime and (2) the coordination of resources available inside and outside the regime to adapt to these pressures. Selection pressures consist of socio-ecological pressures coming from broad political, social, and economic ‘landscape’ developments. They argue that ‘without at least some form of internal or external pressure that brings trouble in the regime it is unlikely that substantive change to the developmental trajectory of the regime will result’. We explore the shift in selection pressure and the creation of resources available to be sensitive to this shifting pressure and look after the trouble that will let windows of opportunity for change emerge. b.1. Shift in selection pressure from the landscape The French case study shows very well how agricultural and climatic changes in the Normandy Seine watershed will increase significantly the pressure that is exerted on soil quality in the region, where the soil’s limestone fraction makes it highly vulnerable to such changes. The increase in the frequency and intensity of precipitation coupled with the replacement of meadows by root crops and/or spring crops, such as potatoes and maize, along with galloping urbanisation, led to a significant increase in the frequency of floods in the Normandy Seine watershed between 1960 and 2000, with damage that would increase to include human fatalities. The connections that were established (expertise) and incorporation of these events (linked to both climate change and changes in agricultural practices) in people’s memories (media, etc.) have exerted pressure that is pushing for switching to alternatives to the sectoral soil management and town planning approaches, in which agriculture and prevention are disconnected, that prevail today. One such change that is currently taking shape is the emergence of a new ‘living soil’ paradigm to replace the classic concept of soil as a substrate or ‘means of support’. b.2. Resources that create public disruption – trouble – within the techno-soil regime Let us point out, before delving into the issue, that it is indeed the liveliness, with its openness and interactiveness, unpredictability and changeability, sensitivity and emotional dimension, that has brought our society, in the name of animal welfare, to challenge radically the artificial and mechanical nature of landless livestock farming operations. This reminder of animals’ status as ‘living beings’ is a source of disruption within livestock farming schemes. It weakens a series of certainties and beliefs about the role that animal products must play on our plates and makes other ways of envisioning breeding and production possible. Destabilising the sectoral soil management regime, in which soil is reduced to a mechanical and physical chemical medium, is thus a must. Such upset in the sectoral soil regime has indeed arisen amongst farmer’s profession. It takes the shape of the movement of soil conservation agriculture, which pleads for a return to ‘living soil agriculture’ (Vankeerberghen, Stassart _et al_. 2014 (to be published)). Moreover, some of the movement’s spokespeople have no qualms about developing this living soil concept in opposition to that of the dead soil that has been produced by our agro-industrial model and his techno-regime blind to the living dimension of soil. However, this development is currently confined to profession. The unease is sectoral and not widespread in the population. It will be possible to destabilise the current regime only if the public is able to gauge the importance of having living soils. Various instruments are available to enable politicians to include living soils in politics and to upset the regime in place. We shall mention two such types of tool: awareness-raising and media publicity tools and participatory tools. On the one hand, certain investigative documentaries have definitely played a major role in catalysing and relaying the concerns that certain practitioners, NGOs, and scientists have shared, albeit in confined circles, for a number of years. Just consider Al Gore’s ‘An Inconvenient Truth’, which put climate change issues on the agenda, or, more recently, Marie Dominique Robin’s ‘Moissons du Futur’ (http://www.arte.tv/fr/les-moissons-du-futur/6815836.html) regarding agroecology. On a more modest scale, the English campaign around the OPAL – Open Air Laboratory – programme on soil and earthworm surveys (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHh7TW2Ude0) and the ‘memory house’ of AVISA – Austreberthe Valley Flood Victims’ Association – are also resources that open laypeople’s eyes to the slow and mostly unseen issues of soil life. To bridge the gap between information and training, and even learning, our Dutch partners’ proposed adaptation of the FAO’s Visual Soil Assessment (VSA) (Shepherd 2010) is an ‘upsetting’ practice to recommend, especially when it comes to its civic version, the aim of which is to turn the problem into a 


public issue. VSA is good tool for interdisciplinary interaction and is easily understandable by everyone. A multi-scale approach – a succession of the three steps of establishing a national soil map, setting a typical profile of the area/landscape on paper, and doing VSAs – should be developed. This makes it possible to keep an eye on the whole picture and on the particular points of connection amongst the various management scales. It gives a nice feeling of integration and of a ‘situated’ exercise. The sensory dimension of the activity, _i.e._ , touching, seeing, tasting, and smelling, is a real advantage. That is why the Belgian team recommended repeating the VSA exercise in France and Belgium with some adjustments. 10 The VSA exercise should help people to hear more about farmers’ historical knowledge. Farmers often gain historical knowledge of their plots of land’s potential from the regular observation of their practices’ results. They may not need the VSA, but the VSA might give outsiders access to such knowledge. The existing regime is destabilised or upset by the combined actions of these pressure shifts and coordination with internal resources that will make these pressures noticeable and meaningful to the players themselves. _c. ‘Fit and Conform’ versus ‘Stretch and Transform’ change_ If we take the regime’s destabilisation as a given, we can consider the Belgian, French, and Dutch cases to be examples of the socio-technical dynamics of change based on three different types of public policy instrument, to wit: -­‐ **the market** in the Dutch case: The CONO cooperative has founded a quality commodity chain that includes the criterion of sustainable soil management in the differentiated quality of its products; -­‐ **the territorial approach** in the French case: The SMBVAS can be seen as an inter-municipal group that is trying to get integrated, multipartite management to emerge from the trickling down of agricultural practices and urbanisation on the scale of the catchment area; -­‐ **the profession** in the Belgian case: Greenotec ASBL is a new producers’ trade association that is trying to transform farming conventions regarding the management of living soil. We shall explain these empirical dynamics briefly using the analytic points of view that Smith and Raven ( 2012 ) have developed. These authors effectively make a distinction between two approaches, which they call ‘fit and conform’ and ‘stretch and transform’. c.1. ‘Fit and conform’ approach – the case of CONO cooperative As innovations become competitive under conventional, regime terms, the ‘soil quality innovation’ is ‘empowered’ in the sense that its developing competitiveness leads to its increasingly widespread dissemination. The implication is that this niche innovation is developed in such a way that it fits into and conforms to a relatively unchanged selection environment, namely, the milk market. The cooperative CONO has to be understood in the overall transformation of the global dairy market. The liberalisation of European milk production will lead to the end of milk quotas and the probability of price decrease. Therefore, CONO must be and continue to be competitive with much bigger dairy companies. This means constantly innovating. Its brand, Beemster, uses the reputation of the Beemster world heritage as an opportunity to give some added reputation to the handcraft quality. The integration of soil quality as one criterion of CONO’s total quality is possible because as a farmers’ cooperative, CONO has developed a double function: on the one hand, it is trying to make progress in the qualification of its cheese products and on the other hand, it tries to re-distribute the added value of this specific qualification along the food chain (4000 euros/dairy farmer). That is why soil quality can emerge on the market as a factor of price differentiation. Currently CONO gives a price premium of 0.0025 euro per kg milk to the dairy farmers who participate in the soil programme. Smith et al. label this ‘fit and conform’ empowerment and define it as processes that make niche innovations competitive within unchanged selection (market) environments. The building of such 

(^10) Adaptation to the soil function/issue, balance between participation of famers and experts, landowners and users, civil society actors 


market mechanisms linked to soil qualification relies on the know-how of ‘innovation brokers’ (Klerkx 2012 ) such as our Dutch partner Boerenverstand. c.2. ‘Stretch and transform’ approach – an attempt from water managers to influence framers’ practices ‘On the other hand, the institutionalization of some socio-technical innovation practices within a reformed regime is also advocated in the transition literature. This suggests that some features of the niche space are institutionalized as new norms and routines in a transformed regime. Here, the niche is empowered by enabling it to change its selection environment, rather than be subordinated by it. We label this as “stretch and transform” empowerment and define it as processes that re-structure mainstream selection environments in ways favourable to the niche’. (Smith and Raven 2012) The SMBVAS Syndicat Intercommunal des Rivières de l’Austreberthe et du Saffimbec/Intermunicipal union to manage the rivers Austreberthe and Saffimbec – that was created in 2000 can be considered an attempted territorial construction of the problem that linked runoff, erosion, and flooding to agricultural practices through their impacts on soil quality. For this reason, a land area rather than a sector is taken into account, with all of its dimensions of interdependence: hydraulic infrastructure, urbanisation, agricultural practices, and soil quality. The actions taken by the SMBVAS mainly concern the construction of hydraulic and retaining structures, its advisory role on local urban development, and also its incentive actions regarding agricultural practices. SMBVAS has gained a fair degree of recognition on the national level (the watershed is recognised as a ‘high risk territory’ within the meaning of the Flood Directive due to its action.) However, this attempt to change things from a territorial perspective faltered because of SMBVAS’s lack of political strength. Its impact on the major agricultural commodities – grain and potatoes – thus remained limited to extension work with the individual farmers. Although the pressure of the socio-technical landscape is increasing on the European level (Communication on EU soil – 2002, Proposal for a Directive on the monitoring of soil quality as widely as possible – 2003 2005, and Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection, which includes the draft Directive – 2006) the overall action of the SMBVAS is evaluated as ‘fitting and conforming’ to the sector, treating the symptom rather than the cause of problems ‘ _What is happening is good for the short term, but what about the long term?’._ The problem of SMBVAS capacity is the building of a legitimised link between the soil and water runoff: The former requires long-term, systematic management whilst the latter is managed in the short term using a sectoral approach. Indeed the territorial approach lacks political legitimacy: Mudslides and flooding are a big concern in Pays de Caux but they are not linked to farmers’ practices in the views of all actors. Material investments such as river engineering works have an unexpected negative consequence: they erase the visible marks of runoff/flooding problems (mudslides) and therefore reduce social pressure on the problems (which are not solved). Resistance is coming from the irreversibility of farming practices that are locked by logics of soil exploitation and cereal production (with the harbour of Rouen) and potato production, which prevents the issue of soil destruction being raised. Consequently, the stakeholders identified a deficiency: ‘... _there is no comprehensive and concerted approach to soil quality’_. They noted, amongst others, the lack of consistency between the territorial consistency plan, 11 Local Urban Land Use Plans, 12 and Water Development and Management Plan; 13 as well as the inconsistencies between individual and collective actions. ‘ _The decisions are taken sector by sector. Everyone makes decisions, but perhaps not with a concern for the consistency of the whole’._ c.3. ‘stretch and transform’ approach within the farming sphere: the case of Greenotec in Belgium Where the territorial actors seems to have failed to transform the technical soil management regime in the French case, the Belgian case of Greenotec showed, on the contrary, that an initiative confined to the profession, one that persuaded farmers to get involved in soil conservation agriculture, by taking a

practical approach to the problem (problems of the soil, organisation of work, etc.) and collective learning dynamics was able to overcome the irreversibility of the idea of the soil as a simple substrate that is linked to tilling practices. This transformation was described in the Belgian case study through the concept of innovation by removal. The normative and cognitive break made in the way of thinking of soil management definitely belongs to the ‘stretch and transform’ type of change: The soil conservation farming movement is spreading across Europe, in all its various forms, after winning over North and South America the (Vankeerberghen et al. _forthcoming_ ). It is turning the humus regeneration model based on the traditional complementarity of livestock and crops into a new virtuous triangle of no ploughing, plant cover, and crop rotation in which the earthworm is both the plough and the livestock that fertilises the earth. _d. Conclusions_ When does transition occur? When the pressure coming from the landscape level and or the pressure from the micro/niche level destabilises or upsets the regime in such way that momentum or windows of opportunities are created that allow convergence between the dynamics of change on the niche, regime, and landscape level. However, change meets with very great resistance from the regimens in place. This is linked in particular to the commodity chains’ lock-in effects, as we have seen in the French case of Pays de Caux. We then tackled two issues, namely, the destabilisation of the regime in place (VSA and climate crisis) and the possible sources of impetus to overcome the blockages and irreversibilities that are linked to the sectoral management of soil quality, _e.g.,_ territorial schemes (Pays de Caux) and collective learning (Greenotec) Our conclusions thus take the shape of two hypotheses. On the one hand, we think that the matter of soils is not sufficiently recognised as an issue. If unease has developed in the regime, this upset is not public. It remains limited to the sector, which avoids fundamental challenges being made. On the other hand, when such fundamental challenges are issued, they can lead to adaptive or transformative strategies, depending on the model of collective action, its legitimacy, and its reflexivity. 


6.7.2.2.2 Taking complexity into account in soil quality management This section focuses on the lessons learnt from the French, Dutch and Belgian case studies as regards management of the complexity of soil quality issues. We shall first summarise the conceptual framework of the “patrimonial approaches” used in SAS-STRAT for this analysis, then we will analyse the notion of integrate soil quality and how complexity is into play in this notion, how the actors concerned by soil quality access this complexity and how integrated soil quality management strategies are dealing with this complexity. Finally, we will identify some characteristics of governance frameworks favouring the development of integrated soil quality management. _a. Conceptual framework for addressing complexity_ The conceptual framework on which is based the analysis of complexity grounds on the “patrimonial approaches” developed by Henry Ollagnon (Ollagnon, 1989 and Ollagnon, 1998) for the evaluation and adaptation of public policies of the French Ministry of Agriculture. This approach focuses on solving “complex and multi-stakeholders” problems, and more specifically – and this from its beginning 

- problems related to the management of “living realities” of nature (e.g. biodiversity or particular species, natural resources like waters), by a “patrimonial” management of qualities of these living realities (i.e. management of these qualities as a common good by a network of actors). In this approach, complexity is defined as follows: “complexity (cum: with, plexus: what makes connections, what makes connections together, to form a whole – [is] both what makes a whole (an entity) and what interacts (the relationships))” (Ollagnon 1998). This complexity is threefold. It characterizes every living being. “Every living being exists as a complex living whose identity remains singular, who grows and reproduces, with a certain degree of autonomy and adaptive variation, in interaction with his species and his environment.” (Ollagnon 1998). Complexity also characterizes the environment (also living) in which maintains and develops all living beings. But it also characterizes the ongoing interactions between living beings (including humans of course) and their environment. “Between a complex and evolving living being and a complex and evolving environment exists a complex and evolving relationship.” Human beings are at the heart of the management processes of nature as a living reality. In fact, “humanity increasingly has to “manage” the state of nature, the state of living reality (“manage” is “gérer” in French, coming from “gerere”: to hold, make, manage, conduct for his own account and / or for others account)” (Ollagnon 1998). Voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, human beings increasingly influence the state of nature through their daily actions (be the consequences of these actions on natural realities intended or unintended). The result of all these daily acts is called “effective management”. One of the fundamental concepts of the patrimonial approach is the concept of management of “total quality” of living realities. “This is a complex notion, at the systemic sense of the term, because the quality is both “elements”, “relationship” and “whole” (Ollagnon 1989). The total quality is at the same time the consequence of the effective management and the element that reveals it. It is defined as the union of: 

- the current quality (which can be observed today), and the potential quality (as it is managed     nowadays for tomorrow) of the considered living reality (e.g. agricultural soils); 

- the quality as a whole and also multiple in space and time; 

- the natural and artificial intrinsic quality, and the human and relational quality defined as “the     quality of the relationships between each stakeholder and the intrinsic quality”, and “the quality     of the relationships between the different stakeholders, in relation to the intrinsic quality” Such a living “total quality” is at the same time the consequence of the effective management and the element that reveals it. Quality “is considered, on the one hand, as a physical object (scientific and technological point of view,) and, on the other hand, as the result of the involvement (positive or negative) of a set of stakeholders operating within an ecological and human unit (socio-political and relational point of view) (Ollagnon 1987). Finally, living realities also have a “trans-appropriative” character: a single stakeholder, with a single economic, ecological or technical-institutional approach, cannot manage the living quality, because it takes place “into, through and beyond each public and private appropriation” (Ollagnon 1998). Degradation of the living “total quality” can then be explained by the difficulties and even disabilities the stakeholders face, influenced by only pragmatic or universalist approaches, to manage these 


“trans-appropriative” living qualities. Thus, the living qualities might not be deteriorated by an “overexploitation” (without denying this reality), but because these trans-appropriative realities are not invested and not managed, in a mode of knowledge and action based on public and private “appropriation”. The patrimonial approach focuses on the modes of management of the qualities that are problematic. Instead of ignoring these qualities or simply reducing degradation pressure, the patrimonial approach addresses processes of “patrimonialisation”, that is, a process in which the various actors concerned by the quality at stake appropriate this quality like an “heritage” of which the actors is a “holder”. From a systemic and strategic point of view, the concept of heritage can be defined as "all tangible and intangible elements centred on a holder which helps him maintaining and developing his identity autonomy by adaptation over time and space in an evolving universe” (Ollagnon, 1979). Heritage does not exist in itself; in order for this heritage to exist, there must be "elements", "patrimonial relations" and "heritage holders." _b. What is complexity in integrated soil quality?_ Soil quality refers to a wide variety of intrinsic qualities: physical structure, chemical properties, content of organics matter, soils as a medium for life (micro-organisms, earthworms...), soil capacity to filtrate and retain water... However, agricultural soils are also an environment that is both natural and human: qualities of agricultural soils also include elements that relate to the relationships between soils and people: soils as a support for landscape and human life, soils as an heritage transmitted by previous generations and passed to future generations... It is difficult to separate fully the qualities of each other like a growing number of objects that are situated between humanity and nature (Latour, 2006). Soils are therefore a complex object insofar as they integrate physical, chemical and biological qualities, and social and human qualities. A soil cannot be considered as “good” or “bad” as such; assessing the qualities of a soil always refer to a specific use (or set of uses) that is considered: a soil is more or less adapted to given uses. Different users can therefore have a different understanding of the quality of a same soil. In the case of agricultural soils, the understanding of soil quality incorporates the capacity of the soils to be a sustainable support for food production. However, the understanding of the qualities of agricultural soils is not limited to its functions for farming. In effect, another element of complexity in soil quality is the multiplicity of uses (by various actors) for a given soil. These uses include active and explicit uses (e.g. food production for the farmer that cultivates a soil) but also more indirect or passive uses (e.g. populations downstream a given soil can be considered as “users” of the capacity of the soil to filtrate and retain water). The 3 case studies considered in SAS-STRAT show 3 different illustrations of complexity of soils through different types of interrelation between different qualities, different uses (and corresponding understanding of soil quality) and actors: 

- In the French case study, we can observe an attempt to reconcile two different understanding     of soil quality on the territory of a watershed: on the one hand, the understanding of farmers,     who produce in a great majority using conventional practices, under market constraints which     leads them to adopt intensive ploughing practices and, on the other hand, water management     organisations and local communities that manage the consequences of agricultural practices     on water flows (strong erosion, floods, mudslides) and wish to develop a preventive approach. 

- In the Dutch case study, a dairy cooperative (CONO) tries to reduce the environmental impact     of dairy farming practices in order to answer Dutch consumers’ demand for responsible food     production. In doing so, the cooperative has developed an integrated tool for assessing,     monitoring, promoting and rewarding farming practices taking into consideration a wide range     of physical, chemical and biological qualities and the impacts of farming. In this case, the     considered process tries to bridge the understanding of soil quality of the cooperative, the     farmers and the consumers. 

- The Belgian case study considers the farmers’ organization Greenotec, which gathers farmers     in the whole region of Wallonia, and supports the efforts of farmers in moving towards     conservation agriculture and use of simplified cultivation techniques or non-plowing     techniques. In this process of transition, the farmers progressively modify their understanding     of soil quality and integrate new qualities (structure, biological life of soils...) in order to     respond to various issues (that are farmer-dependent). These issues include technical 


difficulties (difficulties to plough, reduction of productivity...), economic issues and concerns regarding the impacts of farming on the environment. A specificity of the soil quality issue is that the farmer is the main manager of soil quality through his farming practices. However, a wide range of actors is influencing directly or indirectly these practices 

- Upstream in the production process: farming advice services, providers of seeds and plant     protection products, providers of machines... 

- Downstream the production process: buyers of food products defining specifications for the     products, global market trends... 

- In the territory: local communities, other farmers, farmers’ families, local authorities, local     market 

- At the regional, national and European level: public actors that set the legal, institutional and     regulatory framework for farming and land and water management Another characteristic of soil quality complexity observed in the case studies is the multiplicity of scales and spaces where soil quality is at stake. In effect, many different territorial levels are at play, the agricultural plot, the farm, the local community, intermediate geographical entities (e.g. watersheds), the regional level, the state level, the European level and the global level (e.g. through global food markets). In addition to this multiplicity of relevant geographical scales and spaces, agricultural sectors (e.g. dairy production, potatoes production, wheat production...) are also relevant spaces and governance frameworks that influence soil quality. _c. How do concerned actors access the complexity of soil quality issues?_ The case studies reveal that soil quality is related to various diversified, discrete realities that are included in specific and appropriate spaces (including the space of private land property). It also rests on moving entities that can be part of the land (water, materials, biodiversity, pesticide, fertilizer...). The management of these realities takes place within a particular economical and socio-political context and a particular network of stakeholders. In three different contexts, the SAS-STRAT case studies show three different types of strategies and types of access points in dealing with complexity of soil issues: 

- In the French case study, complexity of soil quality issues is addressed from a territorial     perspective. Initiators of strategies aiming to deal with complexity of soil quality are actors of     an intermediate territorial level (between the local community and the region). The entry point     for addressing complexity of soil quality issues is the soil-water system in the watershed of     Austreberthe and Saffimbec. 

- In the Dutch case study, soil quality is addressed from the perspective of an economic sector     (dairy farming). Initiators of strategies of improvement of soil quality management in the     CONO cooperative, which establishes a link between the requirements of the markets and     dairy farmers (members of CONO) through a policy of construction, assessment, valorisation     and marketing of a conception of quality of dairy farming that notably incorporates soil quality     management. 

- In the Belgian case study, soil quality is primarily addressed from the point of view of the     farmer confronted to a particular issue in its production process. Greenotec is then a tool for     helping farmers to progress in the understanding of their issues and use the tools of     conservation agriculture to solve their problem and go through a transition dynamics that     modifies both their practices and their understanding of soil quality. An important point to be noted is that in each of the 3 case studies, the process of development of a new understanding of complexity of soil quality issues and of management of this complexity does not start from soil quality concerns but from issues that encompass or relate to soil quality issues (water management in the French case, answering market demand for sustainability in the Dutch case, and a variety of issues met by individual farmers in the Belgian case). _d. Integrated soil quality management: strategic approaches to cope with complexity in a multi dimensional and multi-stakeholder approach_ The three case studies considered in SAS-START show different approaches of integrated soil quality management. However, they show that integrated soil quality management refers to a management of soil quality that is integrated in a double way: 


- It refers to practices of soil quality management that take into account a wide range of soil     qualities rather than a reduced set of qualities (e.g. the content in nitrogen, potassium and     phosphates) 

- It also refers to a type of management of soils that takes into account multiple actors and     multiple uses of soils that are relevant to these actors Integrated soil quality management can therefore be considered as strategies for managing the _total quality_ of soils, by addressing altogether soil quality, the relationship of the different stakeholders to soil quality and the relationship between the different actors in relation of soil quality management. However, the case studies have shown that the process of gathering a variety of stakeholders around soil quality issues in a sustainable way requires that integrated soil quality management be encompassed in the management of the total quality of a broader object that is relevant and topical for all stakeholders. As highlighted in the previous section (cf. section 6.7.2.2.1), the development of integrated soil quality management strategies is rather a _transition process_ involving a variety of actors individually and in common over certain duration rather than the implementation of a defined framework or method. This process. This process is typically of several years duration (transition processes of farmers considered in the Belgian case study could last up to 15 years). As regards complexity management, integrated soil quality management can be understood as a process of collective definition of commonly relevant framework of understanding and management of soil quality. This process involves a double definition or redefinition: 

- _Redefinition of soil quality itself_ : in the Dutch and Belgian case studies, the understanding of     soil quality evolves towards an understanding of soils as a living entity that encompasses a     wide range of qualities of agricultural soils. In the French case, this transformation of the     understanding of soil quality is not achieved for the farmers, but the very process of the case     study (developed through participatory approaches) is a first step in a strategy of water     management organisations to share a common understanding of soil quality issues with all     concerned actors. 

- _Definition/redefinition of a broader strategic object that encompasses soil quality issues:_ a key     condition for a network of heterogeneous actors to develop a common strategy for soil quality     management is the definition of a _common good 14_ recognised by all. This common good is a     common strategic object that enables a variety of stakeholders to meet, build a common     understanding of this strategic object and manage its quality together (thus managing its total     quality). In order to enable cooperation of variety of actors, this common strategic object can     be broader than the sole issue of soil quality (though encompassing this issue). This is the     case in the Dutch and French cases, where integrated soil quality management strategies are     considered within the framework of a broader strategic object (sustainability of dairy     production in the Dutch case, quality of the water-soil complex in the French case), which is     (Dutch case) or potentially is (French case) a common good for the various concerned actors.     The Belgian case shows a different situation in which soil quality management is focused on     the famer and its relationship to its soil – as there is only one category of actors involved     (farmers) in the transition process, it has not been necessary to resort to a broader strategic     object. The system of actors that is at stake in this definition/redefinition process is not fixed: there is a process of _co-evolution_ between the understanding of soil quality (and of broader strategic objects encompassing it) and of the system of actors that manages it. As complexity unfolds (by the consideration of new issues, dimensions, spaces and scales...), the associated system of actors enriches with new actors. Any entry point in soil quality management can therefore lead to a process of identification, sharing and management of complexity insofar as the actors have the capacity to reframe soil quality issues and connect to other actors. 

(^14) The notion of common good is different from the notion of general interest: the general interest is identified by a collective actor that has mandate for acting in the name of all (e.g. the State or a public authority) and is usually opposed to individual interests: the role of the collective actor is then to ensure that the general interest prevails over individual interest. The common good is related to a group of actors (that can include both public and private actors), it is freely identified by each of these actors (through a cooperation process or spontaneously) as beneficiary for all, in synergy with each actor’s individual interests. 


We can observe in the 3 case studies considered in SAS-STRAT that the strategies for addressing complexity are _situated_ : there is no standard strategy for developing integrated soil quality management, but rather specific processes that depend on the particular conditions defined by 

- The regulatory framework: different regulations (e.g. the regulations deriving rom the nitrate     European directive, regulations deriving from water management directives, as well as     notional or regional regulations) are putting constraints on the practices of farmers (e.g. as     concerns cover crops) 

- The market constraints: in the French case study, the price structure is pushing the farmers to     use deep ploughing techniques (e.g. potatoes are sold at a better price when they have no     concavities, pushing farmers to intensely plough so the soil offer minimum resistance to the     development of the tubercle); conversely, in the Dutch case study, the market demand for     sustainable farming is an incentive and a resource for CONO to develop incentives, technical     support and facilitation to help farmers improving their practices, in particular as regards soil     quality management. 

- The specificities of the territory: in the French and the Dutch case, specific characteristics of     the territory influence the network of actors and the soil quality management practices. In the     Dutch case study, the Beemster polder is both a particular environment for farming     (connecting soil and water issues) and a resource for marketing of CONO Beemster cheese     (as a UNESCO World Heritage site). In France, the watershed of Austreberthe and Saffimbec     is connecting soil and water management through important erosion issues. One particular difficulty in addressing complexity in integrated soil quality management observed in the case studies is notably the need to act 

- Taking into account the different relevant geographical scales and governance levels (from the     agricultural plot and the farm to the global scale) 

- At the crossroads of perspectives between the territory and the agricultural sectors. _e. What governance framework to deal with complexity?_ The governance framework for addressing soil quality is key for addressing complexity of soil quality issues. Appropriate governance frameworks should aim at: 

- Promoting an ecological, technical, economical and political organization, for the management     of soil quality, in appropriate entities, 

- Facilitating the engagement of public and private actors in the organization and support of the     management of soil quality, at the level of each plot, 

- Favouring territorial dynamics that     o reinforce the capacity of the actors to identify the soil qualities they want to support     o reinforce the capacity of action of these actors, notably by enabling them to invest into        facilitation & change catalysis 

- Enabling constructive interaction between national & European dynamics on soil quality and     territorial dynamics As integrated soil quality management strategies are developed through a progressive process in which stakeholders get empowered and address complexity, this governance framework need be flexible enough to enable a co-evolution of the framing of soil quality issues, of the system of actors engaged in the management of soil quality and of the governance framework. Moreover, the evolution of soil quality itself can be considered as a part of this co-evolution process. Finally the case studies also show the key importance of actors playing a role of technical and strategic _facilitation_. These facilitators support the individual efforts of actors to adapt their strategies and practices but also facilitate the development of a common understanding of soil quality issues (and of broader strategic issues encompassing soil quality) and of a common strategy of all concerned stakeholders. They finally facilitate voluntary inclusion of the common strategy in each actor’s actions. In the Dutch cases study, this role is played by Boerenverstand. In the Belgian case study, it is played by Greenotec (there the facilitation tool has been built by the farmers themselves) and in the French case study this role is played by the AREAS and by the staff of the SMBVAS. _f. Conclusions_ 


Integrated soil quality management is a strategic process that relies on the engagement of heterogeneous actors at different governance levels (rom the farm level to the European level). It relies on the voluntary engagement of these actors managing soil quality in common as a common good. This engagement cannot be achieved solely by classical public action tools like standards, regulations and financial incentives In this perspective, public policies (at the regional, national and European level) should notably be “enabling policies” providing a framework for the common engagement of a variety of actors (farmers, local communities, water management agencies, market actors, civil society...) and facilitating this common engagement. From the point of view of the patrimonial approach, designing soil quality policies (in particular European soil quality policies) requires to deepen several questions: 

- The identification of the modalities of effective management of soil quality in a sufficient variety     of national situations, notably the relationship that links users in charge of the utilitarian     characteristics of soils and the stakeholders concerned by sustainability of soils (type of     stakeholder, type of patrimonial relation to soil quality, relation of property or usage to soils...) 

- The identification of conditions and means for a better management of soil quality, taking into     account the specific economic, social, political... context of each country and its influence on     the relations of the various stakeholders to soils 

- The identification of the fields of application of the subsidiarity principle in the framework of a     European policy Finally, the design of soil quality policies should also start from volunteer territories and actors, and take stock of effective situations of integrated soil quality management. 


6.7.2.2.3 Contributions of scientific and technical tools to soil quality management In the three case studies considered in SAS-STRAT, we can observe the presence and important role of scientific and technical tools: 

- In the French case study, scientific and technical tools are used or monitoring the watershed     of Austreberthe and Saffimbec, the flooding and the water quality. 

- In the Belgium case study, Greenotec NGO supports the farmers by bringing technical advice     to facilitate transition towards simplified cultivation techniques. They mobilise tools like soil     profiles to help farmers understanding the different qualities of their soils. 

- In the Dutch case study, a specific soil quality assessment tool has been developed: the     Visual Soil assessment (VSA) tool. In the case studies and in the two previous sections of their transversal analysis, we have established that integrated agricultural soil quality management can be defined as 

- A transition processes in which the farmers progressively transform both their understanding     of soil quality and their practices of soil quality management by incorporating new dimensions     and qualities in their understanding of soil quality issues. 

- Is a strategic process in which a heterogeneous network of actors (farmers, authorities at     different territorial levels, water managers, technical advisers, local communities, buyers of     agricultural products...) try to improve soil quality itself, the relationship of each actor to soil     quality and the relationships between the different actors as concerns soil quality. A condition     for these heterogeneous actors to develop a common strategy of soil quality management is     the identification of a common good shared by the different actors. Therefore, integrated soil quality management supposes an evolution of the understanding of soil quality by the various concerned actors at two different levels: the understanding of soil quality of each individual actor on the one hand, and an emerging common understanding. Scientific and technical tools play a role in both these aspects. At first, we will introduce the key characteristics of the VSA tool introduced in the framework of the Dutch case study. Then, we will consider two key aspects: the role of a particular type of scientific and technical tools: _intermediary objects_ , which facilitate cooperation within a heterogeneous network of actors. We will then consider the new types of roles of scientific and technical actors that appear trough the case studies. Finally, we will summarise the key lessons learnt from this analysis. _a. A specific tool developed in the framework of the Dutch case study: the Visual Soil Assessment (VSA) method_ In the framework of the Dutch case study, the "visual soil assessment” (VSA) was introduced as a tool for mutual understanding of soil quality. This tool is developed by the FAO and focuses on the visual aspects of soil quality. This method assesses and scores several properties for soil quality (e.g. presence of earthworms, soil structure and root pattern). It allows the user to easily identify soil properties that need to be improved, in order to increase sustainable management (e.g. zero-tillage, permanent grassland, low amount of fertilizer application). This method clearly helps the farmer to make decisions in management. Sustainable soil management is closely related to the provision of ecosystem services, such as soil fertility (by carbon storage and decreased nutrient leaching), decreased greenhouse gas emissions, decreased erosion rates, water retention and water quality. Use of the VSA creates new insight for the debate about the integrated management of the soil amongst different stakeholders. The VSA-method has been reworked to make it applicable for Dutch conditions 15. The accuracy of this tool was tested in 2012 by comparing visual observations with laboratory measurements (Sonneveld et al., 2013) During the Dutch case study in the Beemster area, we showed that CONO cheese factory and Ben&Jerry’s are leading the sustainability debate in the Netherlands and in the Beemster region. They took steps, tried to be ahead and invest money and time in monitoring, evaluating, scoring and improving the sustainability measures of their members, the factory, the area and the other actors within the chain. Instruments developed by CONO (like the COW Compass) have been taken over as 

(^15) The Dutch version of the VSA was launched in September 2013, and is now accessible at [http://mijnbodemconditie.nl](http://mijnbodemconditie.nl) 


good practice by other dairy factories all over the Netherlands. For soil, they were actively looking for a better and more farmer-friendly score, so they adopted the Dutch version of the VSA. Considering the different levels of government (EU, Nation, Province, Water board, Farm, parcel) it seems that the farmer himself is making the big difference between good or bad soil management, although he can be highly influenced by decisions of overarching collaborations (such as CONO over the dairy farms in the Beemster). The starting point of sustainable management occurs at the smallest level, which is farm and plot level. This is where the VSA comes in and is a powerful method for creating insight and optimizing soil management. The CONO cheese factory wants to stimulate good management practices and tries to reward farmers by doing so. _b. A specific role of “intermediary objects” for facilitating cooperation within a heterogeneous network of actors_ In the Dutch and Belgian cases studies, the VSA tool or soil profiles have a specific role insofar as they are tools 

- with a sound scientific and technical basis 

- that are easily interpreted in the conceptual, cultural and practical framework of different types     of actors (e.g. scientists, farmers, market actors...) 

- for knowledge and for action 

- of technical ad social nature, insofar as they are both technically sound and enable actors of     different nature, backgrounds, knowledge types... to gather and discuss soil quality issues In order to understand the specificity of these tools in soil quality management, a useful framework is given by the notion of “intermediary objects” proposed by Jeantet and Vinck (1995) in order to explain the role of technical objects (physical objects that are support for interactions like sketches, prototypes, experimental constructions...) that are support of social interactions in design processes. These intermediary objects are not only pure support for information but also constitute means of mediation as they enable negotiations and compromises. Another useful notion is the notion of “hybrid object” developed by Bruno Latour (1991) in order to give account of objects that are both in the sphere of nature and society (e.g. HIV, the ozone layer, the climate) and cannot be fully understood through the sole tools of the sciences of nature or the sole tools of sociology. Agricultural soils are typically such a hybrid object. Dealing with this kind of hybrid objects requires resorting to both science and social interactions (including interactions between scientists or experts and non-scientific actors). In this perspective, we can understand the role of tools like VSA or soil profiles as intermediary objects (in the sense of Jeantet and Vinck) that help structuring and developing interactions between actors of different nature in order to understand and manage agricultural soils as a hybrid object. The intermediation function played by these tools in fulfilled simultaneously in at least two ways: 

- these tools constitutes an intermediary between the soils and an heterogeneous system of     actors that is concerned by soil quality; 

- they constitute an intermediary between these actors of different nature, insofar as they can     be easily understood and interpreted in each actor’s own framework of understanding and     action, they facilitate the evolution of each actor’s understanding of soil quality issues (e.g.     transition towards a conception of soil as a living entity) and they are a support for building a     common understanding between the different actors in the system; If we understand integrated soil quality management as a process of co-evolution between soil quality and the system of actors that manages it, these intermediary objects can be considered as support for this co-evolution. They are therefore linked to a particular moment of the co-evolution process. In a further stage of the co-evolution process, new or adapted intermediary objects can be needed, thus translating a new state of the needs and of the comprehension framework of the different actors in the system of action. _c. A renewed role of scientific and technical actors: technical mediation_ The case studies considered in SAS-STRAT also show a specific role of scientific or expert actors playing a role of translation and mediation by facilitating the access of non-expert actors to scientific knowledge and technical capacities. In the Dutch case study, this role is played by Boerenverstand with the support of Wageningen University and in the Belgian cases study, this role is played by Greenotec association. They perform a key function of technical mediation or innovation brokers 


acting as a catalyst for change (ex: Greenotec, Boerenverstand). They contribute to the transformation of soil quality management by: 

- Raising awareness of soil quality issues at individual level, 

- Supporting collective learning process by facilitating access to scientific results and technical     tools, 

- Facilitating multi-stakeholder discussion around a shared reality, 

- Facilitating cultural change (e.g. move from a view of soil as support to a view of living soils), 

- Providing technical tools (VSA an soil profiles) that play a role of intermediary objects that can     facilitate a recomposition of the understanding of soil issues and enable an integrated     assessment of many dimensions of soil quality This role of technical mediation is both of a technical and of a social nature and therefore requires a double competence of these mediators: a technical competence on the one hand, and social skills of facilitation on the other hand. _d. Key lessons learnt from the case studies_ A specificity of the VSA and soil profiles analysis methods lies in the fact that they are both scientifically sound and able to be reached directly (through the human senses) by the farmers, without any technical intermediary (e.g. a measurement device). In addition, they are supported by a concrete medium, the soil itself, and therefore fits in a direct relation between the farmer and his soil and the results are more easily appropriated and interpreted by the farmers (who can establish a direct link between the observation and their farming practices). This visual/concrete aspect seems to be a key factor in the success of these technical tools as intermediary objects. The scientific robustness of the tool is also very important for trustworthiness and for the capacity of the technical tool to fit in the universalist framework of interpretation and thinking of actors like scientists and experts, public authorities and companies (e.g. CONO). However, the objective of these tools is not to objectify universally valid facts but to facilitate learning processes and change dynamics. Both intermediary objects and technical mediators help the various concerned actors to create together a common language and common representations (e.g. through discussions around the “soil pits” in order to discuss the interpretation of soil profiles or VSA results). Hence, they are not only supporting tools not only or the famers, but are also actually or potentially a useful tool for a wide range of actors (e.g. companies like CONO engaged in processes of soil quality assessment and promotion, scientists and experts engaged in interactions with farmers, public actors developing soil quality policies...). 


**6.7.2.3 Recommendations** Grounding on the results of the case studies and on their transversal analysis, the SAS-STRAT team proposes the following recommendations. These recommendations also integrate the outcomes of the last session of the Integration workshop that were developed together with the workshop participants. 6.7.2.3.1 Fostering multi-stakeholder and multi-level processes The case studies and their analysis have shown that developing integrated soil quality management requires developing a multi-stakeholder process (including public authorities, farmers, farming advisers, market actors, local communities, associations...) that will gradually modify the understanding and actions of the various actors and favour the emergence of a common strategy. In particular, public policies (including incentives) for soil quality should be designed through dialogue with all actors. As shown through the case studies and their analysis, soil quality management is a multilevel issue that engages a variety of governance levels: the local and regional level (territorial level), the national level and the European (and international) level. Conditions for developing such multi-stakeholder and multi-level processes include: 

- The creation of exchange forums at the territorial, national and European level. These     exchange forums should notably gather stakeholders from different governance levels. In     particular, exchange forums developed at the national level should also include territorial     actors from territories in which territorial exchange forums are organised. 

- Multi-stakeholder processes should associate a wide variety of actors beyond farmers     (consumers, market actors, local communities, farming advisers, landowners...). All     stakeholders should be included (or at least proposed to be included) from the beginning, in     particular the farmers, so that no one is facing fait accompli. Including the whole variety of     actors is also a condition for developing mutual understanding between these actors. 

- Begin with the adaptive action to go towards transformative action: the starting point of the     process is the current state of the governance framework and system of action and the     building of a common understanding of soil quality issues and of a common strategy within a     heterogeneous system of actors is a process that takes time to develop. First actions taken     through these multi-stakeholder processes should therefore aim to improve soil quality     management within the current framework of action then, during the course of the process, the     development of a common understanding and strategy and the evolution of the relationship     between the different stakeholders may lead to evolutions in the governance framework and     the system of action. 

- These multi-stakeholder processes are also collective learning processes. They should favour     mutual learning by acknowledging this collective learning dimension (everyone has something     to learn in the process), welcoming all types of inputs and types of knowledge (scientific     knowledge as well as knowledge based on experience and practice). 

- Finally, at the territorial level, multi-stakeholder processes should include a practical     dimension through e.g. farm visits or on-field discussion on the basis of soil profiles or Visual     Soil Assessment results. At a European or transnational level, collective learning processes based on the presentation and common analysis of cases (including territorialised cases), such as the SAS-STRAT Integration workshop (Paris, 17 th^ - 18 th^ march 2013) can be a useful tool to 

- Identify concrete processes of integrated soil quality management, their innovativeness,     their limits and the obstacle they still have to lift 

- Identify elements of public policies for supporting these processes and favour cooperation     between multiple types of stakeholders 

- Progress towards a common understanding of integrated soil quality and the means to     develop within a pluralistic group of actors (farmers and their professional organisations,     policy makers at the regional, national and European level, soil scientist and experts,     market actors, extension services, local communities, civil society organisations...) 6.7.2.3.2 How to design public policies for soil quality? 


Most often, the mere existence of a public policy on a particular issue is a condition (or a strong facilitating factor) for public actors to address this issue, as they need legal basis to do so. The case studies and their analysis (carried out together with stakeholders) enabled to sketch out some characteristics of suitable public policies in the field of soil quality. These characteristics are developed hereafter. A key factor in soil quality management is the transformation of the understanding of soils by farmers to include the notion of living soil (acting as a partner for agricultural production rather than a passive medium). Public policies should include the promotion of this understanding of soils as a goal. Soils are managed by the farmers in the framework of private property of soils. However, soil quality has an influence on a wide range of actors. It should therefore be managed as a common good (or common heritage) through voluntary project entities gathering the different concerned stakeholders and with the support of appropriate facilitation tools. Soil quality management takes place in concrete territories that integrate all type of issues (water quality issues including the issue of nitrates, soil quality issues, biodiversity issues, economic issues...). A usual mode of action in public action is to address issues in silo through sectoral policies, which influence farming practices (and sometimes impose strong constraints on them). As these general and sectoral policies multiply, integration between these policies at the territorial level becomes more and more difficult. Rather than taking the form of an additional sectoral policy focused on the management of soils a resource, soil quality policies can alternately favour the development of territorial policies that take into account a resource. Transversality is needed in public policies so that possible contradictions could be identified and overcome. Such transversality could only be developed at the territory level. A national or European public policy on soil quality issues should also introduce levels of subsidiarity. In effect, the case studies have shown that integrated soil quality management can develop in an indirect way, i.e. through the management of other issues relevant for all actors at a territorial level, and which include soil quality issues (e.g. quality of the soil-water complex or quality of dairy farming). These broader issues are case-dependent and vary from one territory to another. In the perspective of subsidiarity, public policy should conciliate the use of standards (if needed) and the tool of contract with territorial and sectoral actors, which gives room for flexibility and adaptation to specific territorial and sectoral contexts. The case studies and their analysis have shown that integrated soil quality management supposes a process of progressive transformation of farming practices. A public policy on soil quality should therefore take into account this dynamic dimension by taking into account the notion of path of changes in agriculture and adopting a dynamic vision of soil quality. Moreover, these public policies should also take into account the different time scales (time scales of field actors, of research, of administration) in the perspective of a living process of change. In particular, transition processes are long processes for farmers that can last more than a decade. In this dynamic perspective, soil quality policies should notably help identifying handicaps or obstacles in transition processes and support their overcoming. In particular, the benefits of investing in soil quality can take several years to appear fully, while the costs of quitting some conventional farming practices are often instantaneous. The issue of financial support of this transition phase should also be taken into account in public policies at a national and/or territorial level. Agricultural soils are entities that are both natural and human-shaped. Integrated soil quality management requires both scientific and technical tools and socio-political processes. Soil quality policies should therefore integrate social and economic dimensions in addition to the physical, chemical and biological dimensions of soils. Promoting sustainable soil quality management requires developing project dynamics at the territorial or sectoral level. In order to favour the positive engagement of the different types of actors, these project should enable the development of win-win situations in which the common good identified by the different engaged actors is in synergy with each actor’s interest. Moreover, as different initiatives exist for development of sustainable soil quality management, identifying these initiatives, favouring exchanges of experience (at the national and European level) and analysing the return of experience of the existing initiatives can be a starting point for the design of soil quality management policies. 6.7.2.3.3 Organisation of farmers – encouraging a collective learning process among farmers 


The case studies have shown that collective learning processes among farmers are powerful tools to support transition in farming practices. These processes gather voluntary farmers who find support for solving their own issues and/or who are motivated by incentives (e.g. price premiums from buyers of food products in the case of CONO, public subsidies for funding the transition phase in the soil quality policy of the Swiss canton of Bern). In particular, exchanges between farmers in small groups, to share experience, in a friendly atmosphere favours empowerment and trust building and create a feeling of a common process. These collective learning processes require several conditions: 

- The voluntary character of the engagement of farmers 

- Facilitators who support dialogue and exchanges between farmers and with other actors (role     played by Greenotec and Boerenverstand) 

- Access to technical and scientific resources (technical advice, farming equipment, support     from soil scientists...) to be experienced by farmers. 

- Actors playing a role of technical mediation and facilitate the translation between the scientific     sphere and the sphere of farmers’ practices. Some actors can cumulate this function with the     facilitation function. Such collective learning processes should be encouraged, though without reducing the autonomy of farmers in these processes. This could be done by different means, notably 

- Supporting existing organisations (like Greenotec in Belgium) which facilitate collective     learning processes and support transition of farmers towards more sustainable soil     management 

- Favouring the gathering of farmers in local & regional groups 

- Favouring contractual and voluntary mechanisms between farmers and other actors who can     constitute resources (notably technical resources) in the collective learning process. 6.7.2.3.4 How to address soil quality in education? The evolution of the cognitive framework (of farmers and other stakeholders) for understanding soils is a central element in the development of integrated soil quality management strategies. In effect, integrated soil quality management requires a holistic understanding of soils as a living entity rather than soil as a substrate. Changing this cognitive framework is not only a matter of developing collective learning process among farmers, it is also a matter of education and professional training as this is a key element in the formation of the cognitive framework of the different actors (in particular farmers and other professional actors in the food sector like market actors, farming advisors... but also consumers, public authorities...). The promotion of quality of “living soils” can be carried out at all levels and with all types of publics (including children), and soil quality can be integrated into education programmes. Showing concretely soil quality (showing soil profiles, earthworms...) is in particular a good way for raising interest of non- professional actors (in particular pupils). Evolutions in the education and professional training as regards soil quality management can be facilitated by dialogue and collective learning processes involving farmers, other professional actors, consumers, public authorities and civil society actors. 6.7.2.3.5 Developing the contribution of research, expertise and extension services As showed in the transversal analysis of the case studies (cf. section 6.7.2.2.3), technical and scientific actors play a key role in the development of integrated soil quality management strategies. Their contribution in these strategies is to propose tools supporting multi-stakeholder processes ad collective learning processes rather than proposing prescriptive tools. Soil scientists as well as actors in a position of technical and scientific mediation (who can be scientists or other types of actors) are should therefore be integrated in the development of integrated soil quality management strategies from the beginning of the process and cooperation between scientists, farmers and technical mediators should be favoured. Extension services can play a role of facilitation of change (by giving advice and technical resources supporting evolution towards integrated soil quality management) or conversely be a factor of 


reinforcement of socio-technical locks (by orienting farmers towards mainstream practices). In this perspective, public policies addressing soil quality management should play a particular attention to this type of actor. In national contexts where extension services is mainly provided by public organisations, they can be used in public policy as strong drivers for change (see e.g. the role of public extension services in the Danish policy for pesticide reduction). In contexts where extension services are mainly provided by private actors, the voluntary engagement of these actors should be sought both at the national and territorial level. 6.7.2.3.6 Other recommendations The recommendations produced with stakeholders during the SAS-STRAT Integration workshop (Paris, 1 7 th^ 18 th^ June 2013) also include a few recommendations that do not fit in the previous subsections and do not give matter for a specific subsection. These recommendations are given hereunder: 

- Creating public awareness and favouring public debate on soil quality issues by showing the     advantages of sustainable soils for all actors (not only for farmers) 

- Rebuilding a relationship between urban people and soils 

- Favouring connections between the territorial level and the global level and interacting with     international bodies (FAO, United Nations, Secretariat of the international Convention on     biological diversity, ...) 

- Connecting to markets by including soil quality in official property acts and working with buying     centres and market intermediaries 

- Mobilising various funding schemes and ne methods of fundraising (e.g. protection fund     fuelled by public and/or private funds) 

- Adapt the tax schemes for agricultural machines in order to favour equipment less damaging     for soils. 


## 7 Anticipated use and application of results 

There is much to do about 'ecosystem services’. Farmers manage a large part of our soils and they try to minimize inputs and maintain or improve (quality and quantity) outputs. The better they do, the better it is for them (for their income) and for society. Improving soil quality gives long term efforts and is not always in line with short term profits. The quality of the soil is a theme that needs to be addressed continuously. The “visual soil assessment” can play an important role in the promotion of (more holistic) soil quality. Beside the overwhelming amount of chemical indicators it can add an extra score that helps to (again) make the farmer actually look at his soil and gives direct feedback how to further improve. The most important first step is to make the score. So institutes (like the water board or the local governments) can promote, encourage the scoring. A relatively new actor is the milk company that needs to sell the milk on a marked that demands more sustainability. Also there the first steps are to promote and encourage the farmers to score. Because of the practical, more holistic way of approaching soil quality, the scoring was at the end of 2013 taken over by other dairy companies like FrieslandCampina (which is among the 5 larges dairy companies in the world). Also schools started to train agricultural students and the VSA score is a subject of many study groups now. Of course this is only a beginning. There is more time needed to develop the scores for other types of soils. Also the exact meaning of a higher score in relation to ecosystem services need to be further clarified. Probable a combination of N, P and C nutrient cycle calculations, chemical soil samples together with visual indicators can score the farm (or better the farmer) as a whole. In the upcoming years a PhD student (Maricke van Leeuwen) will further work on the visual soil assessment. One of the goals is to find more scientifically proof of the relation between visual indicators and chemical indicators. Also to make a step toward that can finally lead to rewarding better soil quality/soil management (eco system services).

### 10.1 Annex 1 – Extract of the SAS-STRAT main webpage 


### 10.2 Annex 2 – Common grid of analysis 

The three approaches are based on a literature review and the expertise gathering and analysis of stakeholders (scientists, experts, elected people, but also farmers, inhabitants of the territories **...** ). Through exchanges and meetings of all partners of the SAS-STRAT project, a common grid of analysis was built, which will be used in each case study, for the literature review and the questioning of the actors. Questions to be answered through review of literature (books and articles), policy documents, Internet sites, reports on meetings, reports of projects in the area 

- What are the characteristics and unique qualities of this specific soil? 

- What is the history of this soil? (Use of soils, activities, geology **...** ) 

- What is the historical trajectory on soil management: what were the past practices, what are the     current practices? 

- What are the devises/objects that steer the management of the farm/farmer: soil profile, (chemical)     analysis, observation of flooding and drought, earthworms, etc.? 

- Which kind of knowledge is necessary? Farmer practical knowledge, observations, technical     agency, research centre, etc.? 

- How can this be an example of integrated sustainable management of soil quality? 

- How came the question of quality (sustainability) of soil management issue at the agenda? 

- Who did what? What are the consequences of these actions? What consequences can be drawn     out? Strategic grid for the micro-macro/systems analysis The three research-intervention teams will use the same definition of the strategic issue at stake (formulated in terms of quality management) like “Conditions and means of a better management of soil total quality in the considered territory?” The first phase of literature review will be followed in the three countries by a “procedural phase” in which each research-intervention team will meet strategic representatives of macro actors (actors who have global expertise) and micro actors (actors who have local expertise). Each actor will develop a “micro macro expertise” about the strategic issue at stake with the help of the facilitator. The three research-intervention teams will use the following common grid of analysis. Practical note: In this document, the following elements are pointed out: 

- in black: the questions of the standard IDPA grid (coming from the patrimonial approach) and the     questions of the questionnaire established for the Dutch and Belgium case that are identical but     not formulated in the same terms 

- in blue: the questions added to the IDPA grid due to the confrontation of the IDPA grid with the     questionnaire established for the Dutch and Belgium case 

- in green: added questions that will be asked at the end of the interviews (questions taken from the     questionnaire for the Dutch and Belgium case) 


The common grid of analysis: I) IDENTIFICATION OF THE SITUATION, THE CONCERNED STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PROBLEMS I1) What are the main emergent qualities / characteristics at stake? (formulated in terms of total quality)

UFR Gestion du vivant et stratégies patrimoniales ADEPRINA Contrat d’audit patrimonial « Conditions et moyens de l’amélioration de la gestion de la qualité des sols sur le territoire du bassin versant de l’Austreberthe et du Saffimbec ». entre Le Syndicat Mixte du Bassin Versant de l’Austreberthe et du Saffimbec (SMBVAS) Représenté par Monsieur Michel CORTINOVIS En sa qualité de Président ci-après dénommé "le commanditaire" et L’Association Régionale pour l’Étude et l’Amélioration des Sols (AREAS) Représentée par Monsieur Jean-François OUVRY En sa qualité de Directeur ci-après dénommé "le commanditaire" et Monsieur Didier CHRISTIN, ingénieur agronome, auditeur patrimonial senior et responsable scientifique du projet SAS-STRAT, Sol et Civilisation Mademoiselle Elise LEVINSON, ingénieur agronome, auditrice patrimoniale junior et doctorante AgroParisTech / Adeprina ci-après dénommé "l’auditeur patrimonial" 


et Monsieur Henry OLLAGNON, professeur, concepteur-superviseur de l’audit patrimonial, Monsieur Ambroise de MONTBEL, ingénieur de recherche, coordinateur opérationnel de l’audit patrimonial Les susmentionnés signataires du **présent contrat** s'accordent sur les points suivants : Article I : Contexte et la finalité de l’intervention La réalisation de cet audit patrimonial entre dans le cadre du programme de recherche européen SNOWMAN (« Connaissances pour des sols durables »), dont l’un des objectifs est de fournir des informations et des données pour la possible mise en place d’une directive européenne « sols ». Y travaillant de façon conjointe avec des équipes hollandaise et belge, dans un projet nommé « SASSTRAT » (Sustainable Agriculture and Soil : comparative study of strategies for managing the integrated quality of agricultural soils in different regions of Europe), l’un des objectifs de l’équipe française (partenariat Sol et Civilisation, Mutadis, AgroParisTech / Adeprina) est de montrer que des actions sont actuellement menées dans les territoires pour prendre en charge la qualité des sols, et que si une directive européenne « sols » était rédigée, elle devrait tenir compte de cette « gestion effective ». Le Syndicat Mixte du Bassin Versant de l’Austreberthe et du Saffimbec (SMBVAS), situé au cœur du Pays de Caux, a été créé le 13 juillet 2000, suite aux inondations à répétition de la décennie 90. Il a pour objet « l’étude, l’aménagement et l’entretien du bassin versant de l’Austreberthe et du Saffimbec sur le territoire des collectivités adhérentes », et travaille avec les autres Syndicats de bassin versant de Seine-Maritime à des études, des actions de gestion, et des actions d’animation, de communication et de sensibilisation auprès des acteurs concernés par la problématique des ruissellements, afin de les faire travailler sur ces questions. L’Association Régionale pour l’Etude et l’Amélioration des Sols (AREAS) est un acteur essentiel du travail mené en Haute-Normandie sur la problématique des ruissellements et de l’érosion. Ses missions sont de trois types : apporter un appui technique à des maîtres d’ouvrages, transmettre la connaissance, et produire de la connaissance par des expérimentations. Elle développe, pour ce dernier point, une activité de type « recherche appliquée » afin de construire des données locales pour mieux comprendre les phénomènes en cours, les données nationales ne correspondant pas souvent au contexte régional. Les réalités transverses que sont les ruissellements érosifs dans le Pays de Caux entraînent des dégradations. Des actions curatives (à partir d’ouvrages de régulation dynamiques) et préventives (à travers un volet agricole et un volet urbain, qui prennent en charge l’évolution du territoire) ont été menées à l’initiative des Syndicats de bassins versants. Même si ces actions sont menées en accord avec les propriétaires privés, il reste à générer un « comportement quotidien de gestion de la qualité des sols » dans les bassins versants, dans des situations qui ont la caractéristique d’être complexes et de mettre en jeu de multiples acteurs publics et privés, parfois situés dans des endroits géographiquement distincts (amont / aval). Ce comportement partagé permettrait de renforcer les actions préventives, en particulier avec les grands propriétaires fonciers que sont les agriculteurs. Ainsi, les trois partenaires que sont le Syndicat Mixte du Bassin Versant de l’Austreberthe et du Saffimbec, l’Association Régionale pour l’Etude et l’Amélioration des Sols, et l’équipe française du projet SAS-STRAT, se rejoignent sur l’intérêt de mener à bien un audit patrimonial d’exploration stratégique, dont l’objectif est de rechercher les **_« Conditions et moyens de l’amélioration de la gestion de la qualité des sols sur le territoire du bassin versant de l’Austreberthe »_** en sollicitant les principaux acteurs, pour définir avec eux la stratégie à suivre pour élaborer cette coaction complexe. 


Article II : Présentation de l'audit patrimonial L’ _audit patrimonial_ est une _procédure d'exploration et de mobilisation stratégiques_ en vue de concevoir et de mettre en œuvre une action intrinsèquement complexe et multi-acteurs, exprimée en termes de gestion de la qualité. Il est mis en œuvre par des auditeurs patrimoniaux, qui agissent en tant que « tiers faciliteur », recueillant toutes les formes de connaissance et notamment l'expertise des multiples acteurs qu'ils sollicitent « en tant qu'experts ». Il vise à déterminer les conditions et les moyens par lesquels cette action sera prise en charge par l’ensemble des acteurs qui constituent le « complexe multi-acteurs » concerné par celle-ci. La procédure d'audit patrimonial vise ainsi à : 

- faire se rencontrer les différentes formes d’expertise et donc d'intelligence (universalistes, expertise spécialisée, expertise des acteurs en tant qu'expert), 

- rechercher des situations positives pour tous les acteurs (jeu à somme positive « gagnant/gagnant », au sein du complexe multi-acteur concerné), 

- mettre en lumière les chemins de changement par lesquels les acteurs pourront effectivement construire ensemble cette situation de façon acceptable pour tous. Article III : Déroulement de l'audit patrimonial La liste des 30 personnes à auditer sera établie en commun par le commanditaire et l’équipe formée par Sol et Civilisation et AgroParisTech / Adeprina (auditeurs, superviseur et coordinateur). A l’issue de ces 30 auditions, une réunion de restitution des résultats du travail pourra être organisée avec le commanditaire, si celui-ci le souhaite. Elle conviera l’ensemble des personnes auditées, et visera à valider avec elles les résultats présentés. Article IV : La grille d'entretien     L'écoute active de chacune des personnes auditionnées se fera selon la même grille stratégique, dite grille I.D.P.A., qui sera aussi la grille d'intégration utilisée dans le rapport de synthèse : 

- **Identification** de la situation et des problèmes : Quelles qualités en jeu? Dans quelles entités    ? Quels acteurs concernés? Quelles offres et demandes de qualité? Quel est le cœur     stratégique du problème? 

- **Diagnostic** de l'action engagée : Quels sont les acteurs actifs? Quelles actions ont-ils     engagé? Comment évaluer ces actions? Quelle organisation et quel fonctionnement du     système d'action? Quelle évaluation de la réponse apportée au problème? 

- **Prospective** : évolution des problèmes et des réponses, échelle spatio-temporelle,     établissement de trois scénarios (tendanciel, négatif, positif), enjeux, menaces, atouts. 

- **Action** : Quelles exigences-qualité? Quels objectifs-qualité se fixe-t-on? Quelle est la     gamme des actions à mettre en œuvre (techniques, économiques, relationnelles...)? Quel     mode d'action des acteurs ensemble à construire? Quel est le chemin de changement     envisageable? Quels critères personnels d’évaluation de la réussite? Remarque : du fait du partenariat, au sein du projet SAS-STRAT, avec une équipe belge et une équipe hollandaise ayant des méthodologies de travail différentes, et dans une optique de travail de recherche, la grille d’entretien I.D.P.A sera enrichie si nécessaire, après l’audition principale, et de façon clairement séparée, des questions suivantes : 

- Quelle est l’histoire de ce sol? (utilisation, activités, géologie...) Quelles sont les métaphores, les images, les histoires que vous connaissez au sujet de ce sol? 


- En particulier, quelles sont les histoires liées aux qualités en jeu et aux problèmes que vous associez à ce sol? 

- Quels sont les concepts et objets qui entrent dans les choix de gestion des agriculteurs (profils de sols, analyses chimiques, observation des périodes d’inondations et de sécheresses, présence dans le sol de vers de terre, etc. ?) Article V : La déontologie de l'audit patrimonial L'audit patrimonial est une procédure sécurisée qui s'appuie sur le respect de cinq règles : 

- avant chaque entretien, strictement personnel, libre et volontaire, l'auditeur     informe la personne auditée du nom du commanditaire de l'audit patrimonial,     et de son libellé ; 

- l'auditeur patrimonial garantit explicitement et personnellement à chaque     personne auditée la stricte confidentialité de ses propos, et celle-ci accepte     de porter à la connaissance commune ce qui est partagé par tous, dans une     formulation qui ne doit nuire à personne ; 

- l'expertise recueillie n'engage ni le commanditaire, ni l'auditeur, ni la     personne auditée dans une obligation d'agir ; 

- les audits donnent lieu à un rapport de synthèse qui engage la responsabilité     personnelle de l'auditeur patrimonial ; 

- le rapport de synthèse et le support de présentation de la restitution sont     gérés sur le plan de la confidentialité et de la diffusion par le seul     commanditaire de l'audit patrimonial. Article VI : Résultats attendus Les résultats attendus par la réalisation de cette convention sont : 

- l'audition et la mobilisation de 30 personnes, 

- l'organisation d’une réunion de restitution (après validation avec le commanditaire). Article VII : Délai de réalisation : Une réunion de pré-restitution sera organisée au cours du séminaire français du projet SAS-STRAT, prévu les 24, 25 et 26 octobre 2012. La restitution devant les personnes auditées aura lieu d’ici la fin du mois de novembre 2012. Le rapport de synthèse de l’audit patrimonial sera rendu au commanditaire dans les 2 mois suivant cette restitution. Article VIII : Responsabilité et confidentialité Les documents produits à l'issue de l'intervention sont la propriété du commanditaire, qui donnera son accord pour l’exploitation dans le cadre du projet de recherche. Les matériels et supports d'enquêtes intermédiaires restent sous la responsabilité des auditeurs. La confidentialité des entretiens individuels est assurée par les auditeurs, sous leur seule responsabilité. Article IX : Clause de publicité Les communications publiques réalisées, le cas échéant, à l'attention des médias, devront mentionner l'identité des auditeurs patrimoniaux et la participation de Sol et Civilisation et d’AgroParisTech / Adeprina. Les communications réalisées dans le cadre du projet SAS-STRAT citeront le Syndicat Mixte du Bassin Versant de l’Austreberthe et du Saffimbec (SMBVAS) et l’Association Régionale pour l’Étude et l’Amélioration des Sols (AREAS).

### 10.8 Annex 8 – Collaboration convention with Greenotec 

Présentation à Greenotec du projet SAS-STRAT en Région Wallonne Audrey Vankeerberghen et Pierre Stassart Dép. Sciences et Gestion Environnement, SEED ULg Campus d'Arlon Av. Longwy, 185 6700 Arlon avankeerberghen@ulg.ac.be +32 473 41 56 45 Le projet de recherche SAS-STRAT s’inscrit dans le cadre général de l’amélioration de la gestion des sols agricoles, et notamment de l’augmentation de l’efficacité des politiques et des réglementations sur la protection des sols agricoles. Il a pour objectif général d’identifier, décrire et analyser les conditions et les moyens nécessaires pour une gestion durable des sols agricoles, en prenant compte de la variété actuelle et/ou potentielle de la qualité des sols, y compris au-delà des aspects de production agricole. A cette fin, une analyse comparative entre trois études de cas au Pays Bas, Belgique et France est réalisée. Le cas belge considéré est celui du développement de l’agriculture de conservation des sols et plus particulièrement de la conception et diffusion de ce modèle à travers l’association GREENOTEC. Cette analyse devrait permettre d’identifier les conditions qui permettent de prendre en compte de nouveaux problèmes liés au sol agricole et de redéfinir ce qui constitue la qualité du sol. Les résultats de cette recherche seront discutés avec les parties prenantes impliquées dans ces questions à un niveau national et européen, l'objectif global du projet étant de fournir aux législateurs, administrations et praticiens des lignes directrices sur la façon d’améliorer la gestion des sols agricoles en intégrant les enjeux liés à la qualité des sols, de l’échelle locale à l’échelle européenne en passant par les niveaux intermédiaires (régionaux et nationaux). Le projet SAS-STRAT prend place au sein du réseau européen de recherche SNOWMAN ( _Sustainable management of soil and groundwater under the pressure of soil pollution and soil contamination_ ) et rassemble des équipes de chercheurs provenant de France, des Pays-Bas et de Wallonie. Le consortium se compose d'un groupe de scientifiques expérimentés couvrant le domaine de la sociologie, des sciences politiques, de l’agronomie, et de la gestion des ressources naturelles. En Wallonie, le projet s'étend de mars 2012 à septembre 

2013. Il est financé par la DGARNE et est réalisé par Pierre Stassart et Audrey Vankeerberghen *, sociologues spécialisés dans l'étude de la transition des modèles agricoles. Cadre méthodologique de la recherche Le cadre d'analyse choisi pour cette étude est la Théorie de la Transition (Geels 2007). Selon cette théorie, tout profond changement de pratiques résulte de l'interaction entre trois niveaux : la “niche” (expérimentation/innovation), le “régime” (organisation sectorielle) et le “paysage” (organisation institutionnelle). Suivant ce cadre d'analyse, nous souhaitons mener nos observations de terrain à trois niveaux :

- soumission à Greenotec du rapport final de l'étude Convention de collaboration entre l'ULg et Greenotec Note liminaire Dans le cadre de ce projet, nous souhaitons construire avec Greenotec une collaboration qui soit bénéfique à la fois pour nous et pour les membres de l'asbl. À cette fin, nous suggérons cette convention de collaboration permettant de clarifier les attentes de chaque partie et d'objectiver la procédure de recherche. Nous tenons à préciser que cette convention n'a aucune valeur contraignante: elle constitue plutôt une charte éthique d'entente. Elle reste, par ailleurs, ouverte à toute possibilité de modification durant la recherche. L'ULg s'engage à : 


- Offrir la possibilité pour le coordinateur de Greenotec, s'il le souhaite, de participer aux journées de terrain     organisées lors des rencontres entre les différentes équipes de recherche aux Pays-Bas (5 et 6 juin 2013), en     France (24 et 25 octobre 2013) et en Belgique (13 et 14 mars 2013). 

- Offrir la possibilité à Greenotec de participer aux comités techniques du projet avec la RW. 

- Inviter Greenotec au séminaire de clôture présentant les résultats de l'étude SAS-STRAT (septembre 2013). 

- Respecter l'anonymat des personnes interviewées et la confidentialité des informations lorsque celle-ci est     demandée. 

- Soumettre la première version du rapport final à Greenotec pour commentaires Greenotec s'engage à : 

- Donner la possibilité à Audrey Vankeerberghen d'accéder à la documentation que Greenotec possède sur     l'agriculture de conservation, les TCS, etc. 

- Donner la possibilité à Audrey Vankeerberghen de participer aux journées de formation, journées d'étude et     séminaires organisés par Greenotec.

##### Introductie 

Ondernemers in de grondgebonden landbouw investeren in toenemende mate in de verduurzaming van hun bedrijf. Zij integreren in wederkerigheid tussen bedrijf en natuurlijke omgeving en stemmen hun economische activiteiten af op het duurzaam gebruik van de natuurlijke hulpbronnen van het bedrijf. Deze hulpbronnen zijn immers essentieel voor het voortbestaan van hun onderneming. Dit artikel verkent de wederkerigheidstrategie van ondernemers aangesloten bij CONO Kaasmakers die verduurzaming nastreven door duurzaam bodembeheer te ontwikkelen op hun bedrijf. Daarvoor zal dit artikel eerst inzichtelijk maken wat inzichten zijn in het denken over wederkerigheid tussen bedrijf en omgeving. Daarna zal het de kringloopaanpak omschrijven als goede praktijk van wederkerigheid. De kringloopaanpak gaat uit van het optimaal benutten van eigen hulpbronnen zoals grasland, voedergewassen, bodem, ruwvoer, mest en een minimaal gebruik van externe inputs zoals krachtvoer en kunstmest. Deze aanpak is door het bedrijf CONO Kaasmakers centraal gezet in hun duurzaamheid programma. CONO Kaasmakers is een coöperatie welke eigendom is van haar leden (de melkveehouders). Hun duurzaamheidprogramma Caring Dairy is gericht op het verduurzamen van de hele keten van koe tot kaas. In december 2010 heeft CONO het KringloopKompas gelanceerd als onderdeel van Caring Dairy (Calker, 2005). Hiermee kunnen de leden van CONO gescoord worden op aspecten van duurzaamheid. Wat er voor de toekomst nodig is, is een verdere onderbouwing van de kringloopaanpak en nieuwe manieren van scoren en belonen voor het management van de bodem onder het bedrijf. Vervolgens eindigt het artikel met de vraag hoe je kunt komen tot een stimulerende omgeving voor ondernemers via overheidsbeleid. 

##### Wederkerigheid 

Ondernemingen zijn alleen in staat zich te ontwikkelen als ze adequaat reageren op veranderingen in omgeving, vraag en technologie (Fitzroy, Acs & Gerlowski,1998; Herbane, 2010.). Voor agrarische ondernemingen in het bijzonder geldt dat ze te maken hebben met aanzienlijke fluctuaties in de kostprijs, in de afzetprijs van hun producten maar ook in veranderingen van hun natuurlijke omgeving. De kern van ondernemerschap is de mogelijkheid zich aan te passen en te innoveren. Adaptiviteit is hierin een kernbegrip: het vermogen te anticiperen en je aan te passen aan de omgeving, zodat je beter in staat bent te overleven. Dit is vooral van belang in tijden van onzekerheid en shock, of gebeurtenissen die een organisatie drastisch kunnen wijzigen (Janssen & Osnas, 2005). Voorbeelden van shocks zijn radicale beleidsveranderingen, ziektes, energie crisis of klimaatverandering, veranderingen in biodiversiteit en ecosystemen. Binnen de zogenaamde adaptieve management theorie (Holling, 1978) krijgen natuurlijke hulpbronnen een essentiële plek in het bedrijf. Adaptiviteit betekent in dit verband dat ondernemers in staat zijn de 


relaties tussen hun bedrijf en de natuur te versterken, dit in tegenstelling tot wat de ontwikkelingen van de laatste decennia ons laten zien. De adaptieve capaciteit van ondernemers hangt af van de mate van de integratie van het begrip natuur in het dagelijks management en de cultuur van de onderneming zelf: zijn de ondernemers bereid te leren over hun relatie met de natuur (Parsons, 2010). Strategieën kunnen een keur van activiteiten omvatten: experimenteren, nieuw beleid formuleren, nieuwe vormen van samenwerking en relaties tussen actoren aangaan, nieuwe manieren van flexibiliteit organiseren, monitoren van vernieuwingen, hierop reflecteren en vervolgens weer aanpassen (Walker et al, 2004). Wederkerigheid gaat over het versterken van de relatie tussen de onderneming en de natuurlijke omgeving. De ondernemer benut natuur én investeert in de natuur om de voorziening ervan op peil te houden. In ons voorbeeld van de ondernemers aangesloten bij CONO kaasmakers vormt de bodem een natuurlijke bron voor voedselproductie. De ondernemer bouwt aan natuurlijke processen in de bodem waar hij zelf van profiteren kan.

Kringlooplandbouw is een voorbeeld van een duurzaamheidstrategie gebaseerd op wederkerigheid. Het is “een bedrijfsvoering die optimaal is afgestemd op het gebruik van op het bedrijf aanwezige en geproduceerde hulpbronnen en voorraden (zonlicht, organische stof, mineralen, arbeid, water, energie, landschap, ervaringskennis, etc.) en zo selectief mogelijk gebruik maakt van externe input, met realisatie van een inkomen over lange termijn en met respect voor natuurlijke systemen.(Hees et al., 2010). Wereldwijd wordt de noodzaak om in te zetten op kringlooplandbouw steeds groter. In 2011 verscheen een rapport van het toonaangevende McKinsey & Company getiteld “towards the circular economy”. In de Noordelijke Friese Wouden is onderzocht wat de effecten van kringlooplandbouw op ecosysteemdiensten en milieukwaliteit zijn (De Boer et al, 2012). Het bleek dat op een aantal indicatoren duidelijke verschillen waren tussen de 9 kringloopbedrijven en een spiegelgroep van gangbare bedrijven. Het bodemoverschot N was lager, de koolstofopslag in de bodem was hoger, het energiegebruik was lager, de nitraatconcentraties in het grondwater was lager en het jaarinkomen (als gevolg van de hogere inzet van eigen arbeid) was fors hoger. Minder input van krachtvoer en kunstmest en een hogere benutting van het eigen voer, het eigen land en de koeienmest leiden tot kostenbesparingen en milieuwinst. De ondernemer gebruikt de hulpbronnen van de natuur, zoals de mest, de bodem, het water op zijn land, de grassoorten om te zorgen dat bodemvruchtbaarheid op peil blijft. Het is wetenschappelijk steeds beter mogelijk (Oenema et al, 2011, Aarts et al, 2007, Dijkstra et al, 2010) om de kringloop aanpak en het monitoren van de resultaten op de mineralenbalans te beschrijven. Uiteindelijk is het management van de boer van grote invloed op zowel de uiteindelijke bodemkwaliteit en het weglekken van nutriënten naar grond-­‐ en oppervlakte water als op de emissies van broeikasgassen (De Boer et al, 2012). Er is onder melkveehouders veel variatie in bedrijfsvoering, vakmanschap en milieuprestaties in de praktijk. De kringloopaanpak omarmt die variatie in het management van de ondernemers. De kringloopaanpak is geen set van voorschriften en regels zoals biologische landbouw. Het beschrijft een doel: nu en in de toekomst met minder input een maximale output realiseren met zo weinig mogelijk verliezen naar milieu en klimaat. De bodem speelt daarin een sleutelrol. 

##### Met instrumenten wordt wederkerigheid beter inzichtelijk gemaakt 

CONO wil gericht melkveehouders met duurzame prestaties belonen en daarbij is de vraag van belang hoe de ondernemer duurzaam bodembeheer inzichtelijk maakt op zo’n manier dat hij er ook voor beloond kan worden. Bedrijfscijfers, bijvoorbeeld over de fosfaatefficiëntie geven aan dat in het betreffende jaar de bodem goed functioneert, maar het geeft nog onvoldoende beeld hoe duurzaam het bodembeheer van de boer is. Naast kringloopcijfers over N, P en C zal ook een beoordeling moeten plaatsvinden of de boer nu en in de toekomst de bodemkwaliteit op peil houdt. Bodemkwaliteit is echter niet alleen een begrip wat 


betrekking heeft op de chemische toestand van de bodem, maar ook op de biologische en op de fysische toestand. Dat maakt het noodzakelijk om te komen tot betere en integrale score instrumenten. Het gebruik van visuele bodembeoordelings methoden is zeer effectief gebleken in het vaststellen en monitoren van met name de fysische bodemkwaliteit (Mueller et al, 2012). Dergelijke methoden, zoals de Visual Soil Assessment score (Shepherd, 2010), maken al beter inzichtelijk of er al dan niet sprake is van een optimale/maximale wederkerigheidsrelatie tussen de boer en zijn bodem. Daarom werkt Wageningen UR samen met Boerenverstand, SKB en het landbouwbedrijfsleven aan deze doorontwikkeling middels de BodemConditieScore (BCS). De BCS is een methode om de gesteldheid van de bodem en het bodembeheer op agrarische bedrijven ter plaatse te beoordelen. Uitgangspunten zijn dat de methode a) begrijpelijk moet zijn voor agrariërs en makkelijk en goedkoop is in te zetten; b) een herhaalbare en wetenschappelijk onderbouwde relatie moet kunnen laten zien met bodembeheer en c) rekening houdt met regionale verschillen in bodemopbouw. Het laatste aspect is belangrijk omdat de regionale verschillen in de bodemopbouw in Nederland zeer groot zijn. Waar er al veel scores zijn op perceelsniveau, moet de BCS leiden tot een beoordeling van het functioneren van de bodem op bedrijfsniveau. Het zegt daarmee veel over de boer en zijn bodemmanagement. Een recente inventarisatie in het kader van het SNOWMAN project “SAS-­‐STRAT” onder tien melkveebedrijven in het landschap van de Beemster in Noord-­‐Holland liet zien dat de voorlopige scores op bedrijfsniveau varieerden van 63 tot 86 (op een schaal van 100). Op sommige bedrijven waren opmerkelijke verschillen zichtbaar tussen een goed functionerende bodem en een slecht functionerende bodem. De BCS bouwt voort op bestaande visuele bodembeoordelings methoden en wordt specifiek verder ontwikkeld voor de bodemkundige regio’s van Nederland. De ambitie is de BCS te ontwikkelen als een belangrijk onderdeel van het KringloopKompas. CONO Kaasmakers heeft sinds 2008 het Caring Dairy workshopprogramma waar de aangesloten veehouders workshops kunnen volgen en actieplannen maken. Met het KoeKompas scoort CONO hoe gezond de koeien zijn en met het in december 2010 gelanceerde KringloopKompas wat de score voor natuur en milieu zijn. De scores in combinatie met de workshops levert de boer meer kennis om duurzamer te handelen. Het Kringloop-­‐Kompas van CONO Kaasmakers is een uniforme score, waarmee voor een individueel melkveebedrijf in kaart wordt gebracht hoe deze scoort ten aanzien van het sluiten van kringlopen. Hoe meer de kringloop gesloten is, hoe lager de verliezen naar het milieu en klimaat en dat alles in samenhang met een aantrekkelijk landschap en meer biodiversiteit. Binnen het KringloopKompas speelt de mineralenbalans (de aanvoer van krachtvoer en kunstmest op het bedrijf minus de afvoer van melk en vlees) een belangrijke rol. Verder heeft de CONO een strategie gepresenteerd waarbij melkveehouders extra premies kunnen verdienen als ze een laag fosfaatoverschot op hun bedrijf realiseren. CONO Kaasmakers past het KringloopKompas nu al enkele jaren toe maar wil een volgende stap maken en het efficiënt gebruik van fosfaat gaan belonen. Dit omdat de wereldvoorraad fosfaat langzaam maar zeker op raakt en de melkveehouderij minder afhankelijk zal moeten worden van externe fosfaat input en meer fosfaat zal moeten hergebruiken. Efficiënter gebruik maken van fosfaat( door o.a.. minder krachtvoer en kunstmest import) betekent in veel gevallen ook economisch beter boeren. De boeren gaan hier dus ook geld aan verdienen. Maar de keuze voor het terugdringen van het fosfaatoverschot is ook ingegeven vanwege de beschikbare rekenregels en de dataverzameling die betrouwbaar genoeg is voor een beloning. Dit in tegenstelling tot bijvoorbeeld de uitstoot van broeikasgassen waar wetenschappelijk nog veel debat over is (bijvoorbeeld over de vraag: hoe reken je CO2 vastlegging mee?). Elke melkveehouder die lid is van CONO krijgt de mogelijkheid mee te doen aan een prestatietraject. Van deze deelnemers wordt de mineralenbalans nauwkeurig opgesteld. Ook wordt een concrete verbetering afgesproken, zoals een P2O5 kunstmestgebruik van < 8 kg P2O5/ha in 2013 en < 4 kg P2O5/ha in 2015. Voor deelname aan een dergelijk traject ontvangt de melkveehouder een extra premie van 0,0025 euro per kg melk (zo’n 1500 euro extra op een gemiddeld melkveebedrijf). Het is een herverdeling van het melkgeld waarmee de CONO tracht meer stimulansen te geven voor duurzaam ondernemen. Net als de weidegangpremie of kortingen op een te hoog cel-­‐en kiemgetal in de melk. De keuze voor fosfaat is tot stand gekomen in overleg met de 


klankbordgroep van het Caring Dairy programma bestaande uit Wageningen Universiteit, de Stichting Natuur-­‐en Milieu, Solidaridad en het Wereld Natuurfonds (zie [http://www.caringdairy.nl).](http://www.caringdairy.nl).) 

##### Hoe wederkerigheid te bevorderen 

Voorgaande betoog is een schets van de zoektocht naar het versterken van wederkerigheid tussen bedrijven en hun natuurlijke omgeving door 1) maatwerk op bedrijfs-­‐ en gebiedsniveau, 2) prestaties bedrijfsspecifiek afrekenbaar (onderhandelbaar) te maken en 3) de betere boeren belonen. Mest-­‐ en mineralen beleid (nationaal en provinciaal) wordt dan afhankelijk gemaakt van de prestaties: ‘u mag meer bemesten als u ook aantoonbaar efficiënter bent’. Dit kan geïntegreerd worden met de plannen binnen het 5 e^ actieprogramma van Nitraatrichtlijn waar waterschappen en overheid samen met boeren willen werken aan het meetbaar maken van duurzaamheid prestaties. De kringloopaanpak is bij uitstek een manier om dit handen en voeten te geven. Het is daarbij wel noodzakelijk om te komen tot een certificaat, zoals al in eerste fase is ontwikkeld bij het project Bedreven Bedrijven in Drenthe, waardoor kringlooplandbouw als “Green per Definition” ontwikkeld kan worden (naast de EKO gecertificeerde bedrijven). Deze benadering kan begrepen worden door het te benaderen als het vormgeven van overheidssturing gericht op de _‘Energieke samenleving’_. Dit is een samenleving van mondige burgers met een ongekende reactiesnelheid, leervermogen en creativiteit (Hajer 2011). Voor wat betreft het gebruik van natuurlijke hulpbronnen sluit dit aan bij de notie van Ostrom (1990) dat lokale gemeenschappen heel wel in staat zijn om hun natuurlijke hulpbronnen duurzaam te beheren. Hajer (2011) stelt dat generiek hiërarchisch beleid, op basis van ‘analyse en instructie’ nuttig kan zijn, maar dat dit niet de creativiteit en de ideeën stimuleert die er in de samenleving en bij ondernemers aanwezig is; bijvoorbeeld rondom wederkerigheid. Nodig is een overheid die wel doelen stelt, maar vervolgens ruimte creëert voor andere partijen. Bij de uitwerking van overheidsdoelen doelen wordt dan steeds de lokale situatie als uitgangspunt genomen, betrekken overheden de wensen, ideeën en capaciteiten van de lokale gemeenschap, en zijn interventies gericht op overtuigingskracht in plaats van verplichtingen, en worden leerprocessen centraal gesteld in het beleidsproces (Hajer 2011). Overheden dragen zelf met kennis, kunde en regels bij aan het faciliteren van veelbelovende combinaties van initiatieven en scheppen de institutionele randvoorwaarden waardoor burgers, organisaties en ondernemers duurzame innovatie kunnen uitwerken en daar ook zelf direct baat bij hebben. Het losmaken van dynamiek en leervermogen zijn hierbij belangrijke principes; verschillende ontwerpen en modellen kunnen concurreren (Hajer, 2011). Er is sprake van een constante zoektocht van wat werkt en wat niet werkt. Van Gunsteren (1994) noemt dit sturingsmodel _‘variëteit en selectie’_. Hierbij gaat het ook over het zorgdragen dat de beste vernieuwingen snel worden geïdentificeerd en verspreid. Vele kleine stappen leiden hierbij tot een groot resultaat. Het sluiten van kringlopen kan een voorbeeld zijn van toepassing van het denken over de energieke samenleving in het landbouwbeleid waarbij boeren met werkbare en veelbelovende oplossingen komen om duurzame landbouw dichter bij te brengen. In de praktijk van de laatste jaren blijkt het echter lastig om met Rijk en EU daadwerkelijk tot deze beleidsruimte voor zelfsturing van de kringlooplandbouw te komen (Termeer et al, in prep). De ambities van de agrariërs botsen met wet-­‐ en regelgeving waardoor overheden vaak huiverig zijn om de verantwoordelijkheden helemaal in het gebied te leggen. Deze weerstand is ten dele te verklaren doordat waarde conflicten rondom bodemgebruik en de rol van de overheid meer besproken zouden moeten worden en meegenomen kunnen worden in de plannen en doordat initiatieven van de ondernemers en van overheden beter op elkaar afgestemd kunnen worden, zodat men minder vaak voor verrassingen komt te staan ondernemers, hun organisaties (De Boer et al, 2012). Het is van groot belang om te blijven werken aan beleid wat stimuleert tot beter management (beter boeren). Het is in ieders belang om te blijven investeren in de continue verbetering van de kwaliteit van melkproductie en dus ook van de kwaliteit van de natuurlijke hulpbronnen, met name de bodem. Het versterken van de relatie tussen het bedrijf en de natuurlijke omgeving, oftewel wederkerigheid, is bij uitstek een uitdaging van zowel overheden als ondernemingen en agrarische bedrijven. 


Dit project werd uitgevoerd in het programma Duurzame Ontwikkeling Ondergrond van de Stichting Kennisontwikkeling en Kennisoverdracht Bodem (SKB). Doel van dit programma is ontwikkelen en delen van kennis en ervaring over verantwoord gebruik en beheer van bodem en ondergrond ten behoeve van publieke en private praktijkontwikkeling.

## First announcement 

 Version of 11 th^ June 2013 


## Context 

There is a wider and growing awareness of soil as a natural element as important as water and air. Its importance is related to the fact that soil is a support to many activities essential to human life (for a long time, it was even considered only from a food perspective), but also it is a system in itself, on which topical questions today (biodiversity, climate change...) are dependent. In the policy field, the European Commission has adopted in 2006 a Soil Thematic and a proposal for a Soil Framework Directive (this directive is still under discussion) with the objective of “establishing a common strategy for the protection and sustainable use of soil based on the principles of integration of soil concerns into other policies, preservation of soil functions within the context of sustainable use, prevention of threats to soil and mitigation of their effects, as well as restoration of degraded soils to a level of functionality consistent at least with the current and approved future use.” 16 Karlen et al. (1997) define soil quality as 'the capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and support human health and habitation'^17. This definition and its discussion have underpinned the research developments in the first decade of the 21 st century. It reflects the acknowledgment of the research and policy community that soil quality management is a multi-faceted question. Indeed, soil is a complex element: it has intrinsic qualities (physical, chemical, biological), but also constitutes an environment that is both natural (support to fauna and flora) and human (with social, cultural and economical dimensions and values). Although the multi-dimensionality of soil is now widely recognized, soil research has been mainly focussing on physics and biology. The research from humanities is still limited. This may be explained by the fact that soil is seldom an issue in itself for social and political sciences, but is most often considered as an object related to other issues (urbanisation, agriculture, protection of the environment). Soil complexity resides not only in its multidimensional character, but also in the difficulty to separate fully the various qualities of soils one from another like a growing number of intermediary objects situated between humanity and nature. Soil tightly integrates physical, chemical and biological qualities together with social and human qualities. Like for any other complex issue, the complexity of soils can not be reduced by a clinical examination that would enable separate the different qualities and soil functions one from another and would not take into account their interdependence and interactions deep. Soil complexity is particularly obvious as regards agricultural soil. This type of soil currently faces a number of challenges related to complexity and lack of integration. When looking at productive agriculture soils we see that farmers can develop or damage soil quality by their management. Acknowledging this, various initiatives and farmer innovations throughout Europe have developed to address and improve integral sustainable soil management. Among new developments impacting agricultural soil in Europe, conservation agriculture that has provided new approaches, e.g. simplified cultivation techniques, non-ploughing, which, by producing change, reveal the complexity of soil management. These approaches build on the quality of the soil and on the different functions of cover plants (soil protection, improvement of biodiversity, and soil structure, carbon storage...). They improve the biological quality of soil, can prevent from erosion while they often need to increase the use of pesticides. They also provoke changes in the relations among farmers, as well as in the relations between farmers and other stakeholders (local and central authorities, experts, industry...). The impacts of these changes for soil quality only begin to be assessed, often from a single perspective,

## MUTADIS 


while there is a clear interaction between soil quality, agronomic technology, food industry, pesticides industry, regulation, etc. But what do the various concerned actors understand as the quality of agricultural soil? How to maintain, and improve this quality? How to address the complexity of soil quality by developing strategies which take into account the variety of uses and values of soil and their interactions? What can be the complementary contribution of EU and national policy and of regional and local practices? How to support actual transition towards sustainable management of soils and the associated innovations pathways? These are the questions within the SAS-STRAT project and on which this integration workshop aims to shed light. 

### The SAS-STRAT European research project 

This integration workshop is organised in the framework of the SAS-STRAT 18 European research project, which is developed within the SNOWMAN 19 European research network. This project aims at identifying, describing and analysing conditions and means for a sustainable management of cultivated soils in Europe, that takes into account a variety of current or potential qualities of these soils, including and beside agricultural production. It relies on the comparative analysis of 3 case studies in France, Belgium and the Netherlands related to integrated management of soil quality. This research is developed with a participatory methodology and case-study approach, in strong cooperation with stakeholders, who contribute with their own expertise on integrated soil quality. SAS-STRAT is developed by an interdisciplinary and pluralistic research team composed of academics, research centres, consultants and association. The team notably includes actors engaged on the field with farmers, thus playing a role of facilitators of change in soil management practices. The case studies mobilise different theoretical backgrounds to analyse soil quality management and mingles the analytical tools of 

- The theory of transition 20 , that is inspired by evolutionary economist and innovation sociology and     has been set-up firstly in Netherland as a framework of cooperation between scientist, managers     and administrations to understand the dynamics of changes towards sustainable development^21.     In this theoretical framework, deep innovations and transformations result from the interactions     between “niches” (innovative modes of management), the “regime” (the mainstream mode of     management) and the “landscape” (the broader social, institutional and economical context,     beyond the considered activity). In the Belgian case study, Conservation Agriculture (CA) is     considered as a “niche” that emerged from the conventional agricultural “regime” (the ploughing     regime) by the removal of the ploughing^22 (Goulet & Vinck 2011). 

- The patrimonial approach developed by Henry Ollagnon 23 , which is meant to address complex     issues of management of natural resources. This approach is both _systemic_ and _strategic_. This     approach is systemic as it focuses on actual systems of natural resources management as     crossroads of interactions between human and natural systems. As a systemic approach, it

addresses complexity of this system by taking into account the various interactions between actors, qualities and dimensions at stake for a given issue. The patrimonial approach notably relies on the work of Bernard Motulsky for whom “The systemic approach says both that there is no system in itself in reality (i.e. without an observer), but it is nevertheless possible to speak of this reality in terms of system.” 24 Motulsky’s works are a fundamental contribution to the improvement of the living management. It leads directly to a _systemic and strategic epistemology_ , i.e. an epistemology focused on the identification and the resolution of problems, basis of the strategic approaches stakeholders need to manage living quality and, more broadly, to act in an inherently complex and multi-stakeholders universe. The project develops in 3 phases: 

- Development of a common methodological framework ensuring inter-comparability between the 3     case studies included in the project; 

- Development of the 3 case studies (see annex for a short description of the case studies); 

- Integration of the lessons learnt from the 3 case studies and formulation of guidance and     recommendations. The results of this project will give elements on how to positively take into account the different qualities of soils into an integrative and multiple stakeholders soil management strategy. Doing so, it will 

- Outline ways of integrating soil ecosystem services into decision making and governance; 

- Analyse and provide recommendations on methodologies and strategies to build a multiple     stakeholder and multiple quality decision making; 

- Outline solutions for a more sustainable agriculture and agricultural management. 

## Objectives of the integration workshop 

The Integration workshop organised in Paris on 17 th^ and 18 th^ June 2013 is directed towards the different actors concerned by soil quality management: farmers and their organisations, policy makers and public authorities at the local, regional, national and European level, civil society organisations, soil science research community, ... This workshop aims to 

- share and discuss the outcomes of the 3 case studies 

- draw lessons from these results in terms of approaches, tools and governance frameworks to     address and deal with the complexity of soil quality management and support innovation and     transition pathways towards more sustainable soil quality management 

- elaborate recommendations directed towards policy makers and soil science community which will     be integrated into the guidance which will be produced by SAS-STRAT at the end of the project. The workshop will be interactive and will cross presentation of results by the SAS-STRAT team and discussions in working groups with the participating stakeholders. In this perspective, the targeted audience for this seminar is of about 40 participants.
