This report concludes an intership at Deltares, which has been done for a course about 

sustainable urban design at the faculty of Architecture at the Technical University of Delft. 

The assignment that led to this report is about the regeneration of urban brownfields and 

is part of the HOMBRE and Balance 4P projects. 

Since the world’s population keeps growing and evermore moving to urban areas, cities 

are rapidly covering more and more land. In order to prevent urban pressure on valuable 

land (urban sprawl), which can be used for cropping, energy resources, drinking water 

harvesting etc., available land within the urban tissues which is underused (brownfields) 

could be redeveloped. When we look at brownfields in a European context, we see that 

every country has its own (or no) definition of the term ‘brownfield’. A list of the different 

definitions can be found in table 1 of the paper The Scale and Nature of European 

Brownfields (Oliver et al., not dated). In that same paper, a brownfield is defined as “sites 

that have been affected by the former uses of the site and surrounding land; are derelict 

and underused; may have real or perceived contamination problems; are mainly in 

developed urban areas; and require intervention to bring them back to beneficial use”, 

according to the CABERNET network definition. We will use this definition in this report. 

**HOMBRE project** 

The HOMBRE project, Holistic Management of Brownfield Regeneration, is a Collaborative 

Project carried out under the Seventh Framework Programme THEME FP7 ENV.2010.3.1.5

2: Environmental technologies for Brownfield regeneration, Grant Agreement Number 

265097. The project began on 1 December 2010 and has a duration of 48 months 

(HOMBRE, not dated). The main objective of the project is the ‘zero-Brownfield’ concept. 

Hombre is based on providing the scientific and technical backbone to support this. It 

all starts with the land-use cycle. Within the project land is described as the ultimate 

finite resource, underlining the urge for brownfield regeneration. A brownfield is part 

of the land-use life cycle; after losing its former function it is in an in-between stage 

before being developed again. According to the beliefs of the project it is important that 

future brownfield generation is prevented for many economic, environmental and social 

reasons. Land that already is brownfield should be redeveloped or used for intermediary 

use. These uses could contribute or coexist to the redevelopment and help the land to be 

gradually restored until it can be fully re-integrated into the land use cycle. By combining 

technologies great opportunities are offered to surmount the cost barrier by sharing

 the land management costs with other services and opportunities for society such as renewable energy and urban green space and climate control. To reach the main objective HOMBRE developed practical, science based guidance to deliver the concept of a land cycle as a working system for planners and land managers by developing integrated stakeholder communication and decision support technology for the optimal selection of Brownfield regeneration options, approaches and technologies of decision making. One of the tools developed is the BR2 tool, which is assessed in this report. 

 Balance 4P project The SNOWMAN Network is a transnational group of research funding organizations and administrations in the field of Soil and Groundwater in Europe. Balance 4P is a project with the SNOWMAN Network between partners in Sweden, The Netherlands and Belgium and is about balancing decisions for urban brownfield regeneration, with a focus on soil contamination. It is a spin-off of HOMBRE and covers aspects that were not fully addressed within that project. The overall aim of the proposed project is to deliver a holistic approach that supports sustainable urban renewal through the redevelopment of contaminated land and underused sites (brownfields). To reach this the project focuses, among others, on the application and assessment of methods for design of urban renewal/land redevelopment strategies for brownfields that embrace the case-specific opportunities and challenges (BALANCE4P, not dated). The application of methods by the target group “urban planners and designers“ is an aspect that is missing within HOMBRE. 

 The assignment The assignment that led to this paper is to, like described in the goals of B4P, assess one of the tools developed within the HOMBRE project the BR2 tool by the target group, which is planners and land managers. My own background is in architecture and urban planning and design. As a student at the Technical University of Delft I completed a Bachelor in Architecture and am currently a Master student in Urbanism. I will assess the tool by applying it on a test case in The Netherlands, the Merwe-Vierhavens in

Rotterdam, during the design process. The final outcome will be a spatial plan, devel

oped by using the tool, and a reflection on how the tool works in practice. The reflection 

is built up in parts throughout different chapters in chronological order. This way it gives 

an idea about the process of working with and understanding the method. Therefore 

it is possible that questions posed in one chapter are answered in the next. The final 

findings and conclusions (and thus the total overview) are given in chapter 5. The loca

tion will be introduced in paragraph 2.1 and the BR2 tool in paragraph 3.1. The general 

build-up of the report is illustrated in figure 1.2.

 The Stadshavens of Rotterdam are located in between the Beneluxtunnel and the Erasmus Bridge. It is a collection of harbour areas covering 1600 hectares. After the completion of the western extension of the harbour (Maasvlakte 2) in 2013, the port activities shift further and further towards the North Sea. The old harbours near the city center of Rotterdam become available for urban renewal. However, the transformation does not go as earlier foreseen. The aim was for the redevelopment to support both the port and the city by becoming a part of the Mainport of Rotterdam like nowhere else: the center of development and innovation, directly linked to daily businesses and urban labour force (Projectbureau Stadshavens Rotterdam, 2011, p. 8). The report also mentions the chances for revaluation of the harbour character of the city by building living and work environment that are 100% Rotterdam. The corporate identity of the city has been identified in 2001 as a young, international city at the water with a sober and decisive attitude. Ambition, change and involvement are important characteristics for the city (Rotterdam World Brand, not dated). 

 In this report we focus on the sub region Merwe-Vierhavens (M4H). The area is partly still active as an industrial area with port related activities. Because of this the area is not well accessible and the urban space is very open and anonymous. Along the water there are fruits and juices clusters focused on transshipment. Away from the water and more towards the road there are small businesses which are not related to the port. And in

2.1 Introduction 

between there are vacant plots which are not yet financially attractive to redevelop. There 

is also a power plant from energy company Eon. This, together with the port activities 

prevents (re)development. Many plans and visions have been made for the area already, 

by the municipality, the Port Company (Havenbedrijf Rotterdam), project offices and 

students. The municipality has, together with the port company, created a vision for 

the area. It should transform into an innovative living and working environment that 

is complementary to and beneficial for surrounding neighbourhoods. The area should 

furthermore become and international testing location for innovative energy and water 

management (Projectbureau Stadshavens Rotterdam, 2009, p. 5). One of the plans was 

to create the clean tech delta, an area that would pilot delta related innovations, but the 

idea was postponed indefinitely, partly due to the financial crisis. 

The visions by the harbour company and the municipality are very broadly described and 

vague, so there is a lot of room for development solutions. Therefore the BR2 tool seems 

like a very suitable tool for this design case. This will be further elaborated in chapter 3.

 As mentioned before, multiple plans and studies have been done before. A short summary of the 2009 business case and the 2011 structural vision can be found in appendix A. In this paragraph the conclusions of the analysis will be discussed, additional maps, figures etc. can be found in appendix B. 

 One of the main objectives of the redevelopment is to give the waterfront back to the city. Due to the large port-related activities the water is not accessible for inhabitants. Because we are dealing with a city along the river we must be aware that there are public riverfronts along the Maas. Most of them are better situated with beautiful views over the Erasmus and Hef bridges and the skyline of the Wilhelminapier. Map B1 (appendix B) shows the accessibility of the riverfront in the city of Rotterdam. There are long stretched boulevards near the city center, but not near the Merwe-Vierhavens. There are parks nearby, but they’re mostly along residential areas and less attractive and less connected to the city. There’s only one outer dike nature area at the eastern edge of the city. To be complementary to the current situation, the waterfront of M4H could be an outer dike nature area combined with an attractive boulevard providing facilities and which is well connected to the city via good transport links. 

 The area is well connected to the regional and national road system and the Marconiplein zone (zone 6 in figure 2.3) is well connected to the rest of the city via public transport, as shown on map B2 (appendix B). The accessibility by both car and public transportation and the proximity to both the center of Schiedam and Rotterdam make M4H an attractive location. This can further improve if the water net is extended. The main problem is reaching the inner parts of the area from the well accessible edges. There is no designated

space for slow traffic. The streets that border the area also form borders for pedestrians 

and cyclists from surrounding areas. Street patters and lay-out as well as transportation 

links need to be improved. 

The location is on the border of the municipalities of Rotterdam and Schiedam (map B3, 

appendix B). The municipality wants to transform the area into a lively living and working 

environment. However, in the municipality of Schiedam to the west there is a large 

business park zone which is being further developed over time. Therefore it seems logical 

to adjust the spatial and functional lay-out of the west strip (number 1 in figure 2.3) to 

that. The west point (zone 9 in figure 2.3) seems attractive for residential or office high 

rise, due to the location along the water. There are some typical characteristic elements 

in the area which, if preserved, could aid the identity of the place. Old abandoned train 

tracks, cranes and warehouses can be re-used. 

There are already a lot of facilities located in the immediate vicinity of M4H, as indicated 

on map B4 (appendix B). The development of dwellings would not require extra facilities 

and can be carried out from the start. 

There are also a lot of challenges to face when thinking about redevelopment. One issue 

is that of flood protection and water management. Since the area is outer dike (map B6, 

appendix B) there is no pluvial problem, the water runs off to the river. But a rising water 

level of the river makes the land vulnerable for flooding. The current normative high water 

level is 3,6 m + N.A.P., which is already higher than large parts of the surface. The level 

for 2100 is predicted to be 4,7 m + N.A.P. according to the Veerman prediction (Slootjes 

et al., 2011, p. 21). There are multiple solutions to deal with this: we can heighten the 

surface of the area, build a new dike around the area, make a storm surge barrier or build 

amphibiously. Another problem is that the current dike which is protecting the hinterland 

is too low at one point. 

Another problem is the building restriction for housing due to the noise nuisance of 

Citronas, zone4, and the safety zone of the Eon power plant, zone 5 (figure B8, appendix 

B). As long as these companies are active the development of dwellings is not possible. 

In this case we assume that transshipment firm Citronas will move to another harbour 

location due to vacancy elsewhere with the Maasvlakte 2 expansion. The Eon power plant

 is located above a hot water reservoir, so switching from steam and gas to geothermal energy becomes an option. 

 Because of the former and current uses the area is contaminated, at some point a lot more than others. The power plant is one of the sources of contamination but next to it used to be a paint and metal factory (Ferro). Besides those there were and are many more industries that served/serves as sources of contamination. Contaminants in the area are: PACs, heavy metals, chlorinated carbohydrates and others. There is also polluted groundwater (map B7, appendix B). Figure 2.4 gives and overview of remediation techniques (Khan, Husain, & Hejazi, 2004). The costs mentioned are for the U.S. context. There are highly variable costs between different countries and situations, but the overview by Khan et al. gives a good overview of techniques and a basic indication for variables per technique, such as cost, efficiency and duration. Based on the contaminants we can explore certain techniques such as soil washing, soil flushing and phytoremediation. The variables cost, efficiency and duration will determine which technique is best applicable on a certain location. For an overview of the Dutch context please refer to http://www.bodemrichtlijn.nl. 

 Because the area is still an active part of the harbour most of the plots are in possession of the harbour company or in leasehold. It is not financially viable to buy off the lease. The most opportune scenario is to redevelop plots when leasehold ends. That can be difficult when plots around the vacant spot are still active industrial areas. Also taken into consideration is the costs of remediation. Map B5 (appendix B) shows the duration of the leasehold and the remediation costs.

2.2 Analysis 


 The method will now be introduced briefly. For a full in-depth explanation please refer to the PhD-thesis of Leney (2008). BR2 is a method to “provide a means for exploring the impact that brownfield redevelopment will have on the urban system within which it takes place and the exploration of the consequences that will arise as a result of these impacts. Therefore, it can provide a means for selecting redevelopment options based on site specific analysis of the impact of redevelopment rather than relying on generic theories of redevelopment (i.e. building employment generating buildings will reduce local unemployment). In this way it provides a means to select redevelopment options using a robust evidence based approach” (Leney & Nathanail, not dated). 

 A system is a group of elements forming a connected or complex whole (Oxford English Dictionary (OED), 1989b). Traditional approaches that assess the impact of redevelopment assume that the urban system is a simple system and that causes and effects are directly linked. These ways of approaching redevelopment impacts exclude a lot of relations and indirect causes and effects. BR2 treats the urban system as a complex and interactive system that will respond in a dynamic way to change. Within a system like this simple changes can result in unexpected, and possibly undesirable, outcomes. By applying a systems approach, the planned redevelopment options can be assessed on site specific analysis of the impact of redevelopment using a robust evidence based approach rather than relying on generic theories of redevelopment (Leney, 2008, pg. 120-121). The method is based on REMIT/RESPONSE, a procedural approach to rock engineering that applies existing knowledge about a rock mass to develop a model of a rock engineering situation which can then be used to develop procedures to deliver stated objectives (Hudson, 1992; Nathanail et al., 1992). 

 How it works The BR2 tool works via a matrix an N2 chart that models the urban fabric of the city. The matrix is build-up out of squares representing the fabric and its functioning (figure 3.1). The diagonals from the top left corner to the right bottom form the important elements e.g. housing stock, transportation, biodiversity etc. Each other 

##### 14 

### 3. The BR2 tool 

 3.1 Introduction 

 Figure 3.1 The concept of an N2 chart (Leney, 2008, p. 129) 


square is horizontally and vertically linked to two components and describes the relation 

between the first and the second one. So as square 1,2 is the relation between 1,1 and 2,2, 

so will 4,7 be the relation between 4,4 and 7,7. 

An interaction matrix can be tailor-made for every specific site. The methods used to do 

so are expert judgement and winnowing. With the first method a group of expert and 

stakeholders can determine which elements are relevant and important enough to be a 

leading diagonal. The second method is a more systematic process. Winnowing, in this 

context, means discarding the irrelevant. The theoretical process is to start with a coarse 

matrix with 3 or 4 very general elements, e.g. natural environment, built environment, 

policy and finance. Then the elements which do not seem relevant are winnowed out 

(unlikely in the first stage). Next each element is expanded into several sub-elements, 

followed by winnowing out any of these that are not relevant to the site and surrounding 

area. This process is continued until the user is content with the matrix. When done alone 

this can make the matrix subjective. I therefore recommend to combine both methods to 

create a tailor-made interaction matrix. 

There is also a generic interaction matrix (figure 3.2).

 The matrix resembles the urban context of the redevelopment site. The different options are tested by putting them in the matrix as a perturbation of the system. The following steps have to be taken for all the different scenarios. The first step is to identify all the relevant relations in the system. This is also called BCM, or binary coded matrix. Every site is different and so are the relations between different elements. In the BCM relations are marked with a zero when the relation is irrelevant or non-existing or with a one when the relation is relevant. The matrix will be coded with zeros and ones (figure 3.3). These values are summed and plotted in a graph. The graph shows which elements are either dominant or subordinate in the system and if they’re active or inactive. 

 After the relevant relations have been identified, it is necessary to appoint them with a numerical value according to the impact on the system. This is done according to the ESQ method, or expert semi quantitative. There are two ESQ matrices, one with values between –n and n (in the generic matrix -2 to 2 is used) and one with only positive values (0 to 4 in the generic matrix). These values indicate the impact of the redevelopment on the urban system. The horizontal rows in the matrix are the values of the influence the element has on other elements (cause). The vertical columns are the values of the influence other elements have on the element (effect). These numbers are summed up and plotted (this is done the same way for the BCM). The resulting graph shows whether an element is either dominant or subordinate in the system and if it’s active or inactive (figure 3.4).

Based on these outputs, the different redevelopment options can be assessed according 

to the impact they’ll have on the urban context and whether that impact is positive or 

negative. The best option can be selected for redevelopment. 

The generic interaction matrix comes in an excel file (figure 3.5) in which you can insert 

the BCM and ESQ values per relation and which then generates the graphs. 

**How to apply it** 

After the theoretical understanding of the method, some questions may arise. It might 

seem that the method is an objective way to determine what effects changes on a plot 

have on the urban fabric surrounding it. In some ways it is and in some it’s not. Since there 

is no coherent body of theory for the redevelopment of brownfields (Leney, 2008, p. 139), 

a lot of decisions regarding the matrix have to be made based on expert knowledge. 

When done alone or in a small group the outcomes may be subjective. The answer to this 

would be using the tool with a good cross-section of stakeholders and experts. 

Another question that may arise is about the scale of the redevelopment. The tool seems 

very applicable when there is a mono-functional site surrounded by the affected urban 

context. But what if the site itself forms a part of the context? That challenge will be 

elaborated further by looking at the M4H case.

##### 18 

 A full list of questions I personally had after reaching a theoretical understanding of the tool, together with the answers provided by the University of Nottingham, can be found in appendix C. 

 The original aim of the method is to analyse the impact of different redevelopment options for an urban brownfield site on the urban system. The results can be compared and evaluated, and the best option can be selected for redevelopment. The tool is meant for use by urban development project teams. They are the leading party; however, a good cross section of all stakeholders of the project is needed for valid results and conclusions. 

 The tool is always applied in an interactive meeting. There is no coherent body of knowledge for urban brownfield regeneration (yet) and all sites are different. Therefore expert judgement is needed to use the tool, but within a transparent process: stakeholder participation. The approach of the method is covering all steps in the process. It helps to find the best suitable option for brownfield redevelopment. This includes financial aspects, economic aspects, technical aspects, social aspects etc. and relates all these different fields to each other by exploring the effects they have on each other. The urban environment is a very complicated thing. Cause and error is not always easy to determine. To try to define what kind of relations between important aspects in that environment are present and relevant, knowledge about all fields has to be present and stakeholder/ expert participation is needed, which also makes it a communicational tool. 

 It takes some time to understand the tool and to get familiar with it. When the generic matrix is used, the tool is easy to use. It is presented in an excel sheet and is very user friendly. Defining the relations and defining whether or not they are present and relevant (and valuing them if they are) is the difficult part. If a site specific matrix is being produced, it becomes a bit more complex and good knowledge about the site and the surroundings is needed. The difficulty is then medium, since the most important aspects of the site need to be defined in cooperation with stakeholders/experts. Experts and stakeholders are essential, so costs will be made to hire experts and to facilitate workshops. 

 The method is meant for use in the second part of the initiative stage and the design/ planning stage. In the first part of the initiative stage, information is gathered. In the second part, this information is used to model the urban context and define relations 

### 3. The BR2 tool

between them (or, when the ready-to-use generic matrix is used – see figure 2 – instead 

of producing a site specific matrix, the active relations are defined). Then, in the design 

and planning phase, different scenarios are developed and assessed with the tool. 

Comparing the outcomes can contribute to selecting the most suitable option for further 

development. The ideal process would require 2 workshops (figure 3.6). In the first one 

the current context is discussed (and modelled) and the relevant relations are defined. 

The potentials for the area are explored. Multiple options for redevelopment are defined. 

Then, after the workshop, the project team develops the scenarios further. In the second 

workshop the different plans are assessed and the results are being compared. The most 

suitable option is chosen for further development by the project team. Depending on 

whether or not a site specific matrix is being made, the first workshop can last from half a 

day up to three days; in the excercise of Leney (2008, p. 186) the generic matrix took three 

days to produce. The second workshop would take at least one full day. All other aspects, 

such as data collection, design, desk study etc. are also present in the design process 

when the BR2 tool is not being used and therefore not calculated in the time span of the 

tool.

3.1 Introduction 

 scenarios 


 After the theoretical understanding, the first step was to apply the tool on a design case. In order to get a grip on the generic interaction matrix and its content, I chose to apply it retrospectively on a project I had already done for the Bergpolder neighbourhood in Rotterdam. This way the project was merely a tool to understand the matrix rather than using the matrix to develop a plan. The project focusses on improving the air quality and urban environment of the location, which is situated along one of the busiest highways of the country. It entails the introduction of pine trees in the public space, which can bind much more particulate matter (PM10) than deciduous trees. Beside that TiO2 is implemented in the road surface of the highway to bind particles out of the exhaust gasses. However, the run-off water would contaminate the local water system, so the water is redirected into the neighbourhood where it is purified in constructed wetlands. A system to store pluvial water is also integrated. Visual representation is provided in appendix C. 

 When using the excel file, the first notable thing was that it was well structured and navigable and user-friendly. A small detail is that the use of colours can be adjusted, both for functional and aesthetic reasons. The bright colours can be very distracting. In the BCM the cells turn red if that cell is active (when you enter “1”), but red is commonly linked to negative values, whilst here we just mean active or inactive. 

 The most interesting observation was that identifying the relations is very difficult, especially when done alone. It also shows that without proper knowledge of the subjects the results are meaningless; there were no surprises with the outcomes of the BCM. Built environment (Hofbogen structure and street), Public economics (public space), Private economics (businesses) and Natural environment (trees and wetlands) are dominant. The values for the BCM and the reasoning can be found in appendix C. 

 As mentioned before, without sufficient knowledge it’s hard to determine whether a relation is active, let alone put a value to it. In the examples in the thesis of Leney (2008) a lot of mechanisms or relations are inactive because they’re not significant enough. But how to establish this? For example: are changes in natural environment (addition of wetlands and more trees) significant enough for an increase in biodiversity? And if so, is it rated +1 or +2?

 3.2 Applying BR2 on Hofbogen, Rotterdam 


The lack of knowledge can be supported with many more examples. An increased Quality 

of life (QoL), in this case a livelier street, leads to less crime and anti-social behavior and 

degradation of the built environment (BE); QoL > BE. This also greatly depends on the 

demographics and social situation, though. How can we predict the change in the amount 

of crime or anti-social behaviour? We need figures and facts for mechanisms like these. 

Another thing was to avoid circle reasoning. It is hard to establish what effects what, 

for example: does biodiversity affect natural environment? Change in biodiversity (BIO) 

requires change in natural environment (NE). Does it work two ways? It then also brings 

us to the problem of direct and indirect relations. For example: quality of live is increased 

through natural environment. Is QoL then also an active influencer? 

Indirect relations combined with insufficient knowledge can lead to difficult questions. 

For example: the mechanism between QoL and BIO. The question posed in the excel sheet 

is whether QoL may increase volunteering (nature conservation) or gardening (which can 

increase BIO). In this case, QoL is enhanced by NE. Does QoL then indirectly influence BIO? 

It also depends on the type of people living in the neighbourhood. Better QoL does not 

directly result in an increase in BIO. In our case, demographics (DEM) doesn’t change in 

quantity, but the changing of the urban area (removing cars from the street and using the 

space for a constructed wetland) might result in people moving away and other people 

moving in. Will the old population engage in volunteering or gardening? And how about 

the altered population? And how many people will actually move? This shows a very 

complicated issue which seems hard to solve, so assumptions have to be made, which is 

contradictory to the idea of this being an evidence based approach. 

This leads to the necessity of using the tool in a workshop with a group of stakeholders 

who have expert knowledge about the area and the mechanisms. This is simulated in the 

next paragraph.

3.2 Applying BR2 on Hofbogen, Rotterdam 


 The workshop to simulate stakeholder participation took place on 29th of July 2014. The aim of the workshop was to assess multiple options for redeveloping the MerweVierhavens (M4H) site in Rotterdam with a group of people that could function as stakeholders and experts. A list of participants and additional information can be found in appendix C. 

 Introduction to the workshop The M4H site is still and active harbor area. However, plans are already being made for when the port related industries cease activities on their current location. The leasehold of the plots will not end simultaneously. In the first steps of redevelopment, the plot lies within the context of the active harbor area (figure 3.7). The figure shows the difference between the example cases described in the thesis of Leney (2008) and the M4H case. In the examples the plot was always surrounded by non-industrial context and the effects of redevelopment on the context could be modelled. In the case of M4H, the plot is still surrounded by an industrial context. The effects of redevelopment do not have a direct influence on the neighbourhoods surrounding the harbour area, but the industrial context has more influence on the redevelopment itself. Since the first phase is situated on a plot alongside the water and on only light contaminated ground, the plan seems commercially viable the only restraint is the operating Eon power plant. Therefore using the BR2 tool is not very apparent. In a later stage, the area around this power plant (phase 4, figure 3.8) will be redeveloped within the context of the earlier developed phases – dwellings, offices and businesses. The location is heavily polluted and costly to remediate and is located less favourable if eon stays (but switches to geothermal energy). Therefore multiple options for redevelopment are assessed (figure 3.9). In this workshop, only the park option, scenario C, is assessed. The park will be a cultural park. As a reference we can use the Emscher park in Germany. 

**Emscher park** The Emscher Landscape Park is a regional park in the northern Ruhr area in Germany. The goal: urban, social, cultural and environmental measures as a basis for economic change in an old industrial region, the largest industrial region in Europe. The concept of the plan was the creation of a new type of park that connects different spaces together: preserved areas of the pre-industrial cultural landscape, industrial landscapes and post-industrial landscapes. The Rotterdam harbour area is the largest port area in Europe and under constant transformation. The Emscher Park can proof to be a good 22

 Results and reflection On a general note, the participants of the workshop had some trouble defining the boundaries of the site when using the matrix. Sometimes they included the context and sometimes they excluded it. When talking about demographics for example, the conclusion was that there would be no inhabitants living on the site, but the inhabitants of the immediate context weren’t taken into consideration. Relations as natural environment on individual economy were defined as value of housing, but was left out (when it actually shouldn’t have been) because there was no housing on the site. The on/ off site considerations can be confusing. When talking about jobs the participants tend to talk about employment in the area. However, information about where the workforce comes from isn’t available. There can be more jobs in the area, but it could also be that it doesn’t affect the local population; in this case the relation would be irrelevant. More jobs could increase traffic, what would indeed affect local population (and environment). Next time the method is used, there should be more awareness of these, sometimes confusing, relations. 

 The excel file itself is very user friendly and well organized. When identifying and valuing the relations, there was some confusion about the colouring. Red triggers the idea that something has a negative value, whereas green usually means positive (value). It is confusing that the binary coded column turns red when a relation is active, as if it implies a negative relation. 

 Another thing was that built environment is sometimes defined as quantity and sometimes as quality (the relation between natural environment (NE) and built environment (BE) is 

### 3. The BR2 tool 

 3.3 Applying BR2 on M4H workshop 

 Figure 3.9 Redevelopment options for the eon power plant site (own illustration) 


##### 25 

about quantity where the relation about BE and quality of life (QoL) is about quality). The 

expert semi quantative (±ESQ) values turn red (or orange) when negative and green when 

positive. When talking about quality that makes sense, but the relation between quality 

and quantity is not always equal. When more natural environment leaves less space for 

built environment, that is negative for the amount of built environment. It doesn’t say 

anything about the quality of that built environment, though. There could have been a 

lot of low quality buildings there before, whilst the few that remain after the intervention 

become of high quality. The direct relation would be negative (less BE) but that could also 

mean something positive, so the numerical values about BE are hard to compare or sum 

when some are about quality and other about quantity. Overall, the definitions should be 

unambiguous (e.g. quality and quantity is ambiguous). 

The example questions in the excel sheet can sometimes have a limiting or confusing 

effect. When taking institutional controls as an example, we can see that the relations 

with the first elements (biodiversity, natural environment, built environment) are defined 

as protection, which were interpreted as laws during the workshop. Later on (with other 

elements) the relations are defined as effects on planning as well. In this case, the effect 

of quality of life on local institutional controls (LIC) is indirect. Quality of life is for a big 

part due to the change in natural environment, so to value this relation positively would 

be double, since it should already be valued as NE on LIC. But since LIC was only being 

considered as laws, the relation was said to be inactive. The example questions are very 

helpful, but can sometimes also be confusing. 

There are more double relations in the method. This could be because it is hard to define 

what is leading and what is indirect. For example, more natural environment (NE) leads 

to more space for biodiversity (BIO) and less built environment (BE) could lead to more 

space for biodiversity (unless it is only an empty field). The second one is indirect; more 

BIO due to more NE and less BE due to more NE. Another example is between NE and BE. 

More space for NE leads to less space for BE. Less space for BE also leads to more space 

for NE. However, the intervention is a park which makes the first relation relevant and the 

latter indirect. Biodiversity and natural environment are in general very closely related, 

which makes it sometimes hard to avoid double relations (however, we always defined 

that biodiversity increases due to natural environment and didn’t consider that BIO can 

also increase in a more urban environment).

##### 26 

 At the relation between central institutional controls (CIC), e.g. the relation between CIC and NE and BE, the participants talk about the effects of existing policies on the intervention. For all the other elements only what is changed in the intervention is being regarded. If the same would apply here, then existing policies would have no influence on the intervention in the matrix (which makes sense since it is about the effects of the intervention on the urban context). If not, then the relation between LIC and private economics would not be inactive because there are subsidies. 

 A note about the relation between public economic (PuE) and institutional controls; tax revenue is PuE, so the relation is defined the wrong way around in the question (how would development affect tax revenue?). 

 The reasoning of the participants was not always consistent and clear during the workshop. At the relation between private economic and natural environment for example, it was stated that the relation was double and already mentioned at public economic and natural environment. But PuE is about more public money so more potential for biodiversity. Private economic is about more private money, so more development and less potential for biodiversity (even though these cultural companies/activities will benefit from the park and thus biodiversity, they will still need parking etc. which gives less room to biodiversity). More specific questions in the excel file of the generic matrix could be one way to guide the user through complex issues. 

 Another example of inconsistent reasoning is between private economic (PrE) and public economic and vice versa. Between PrE and PuE the participants stated that more companies leave the area than companies that settle there, though the other way around the balance is claimed to be equal. After filling in the matrix, it would be good to review everything one more time to rule out inconsistencies etc. (perhaps not immediately after the session though). 

 Another aspect that is quite arbitrary is to determine the impact of a relation (whether it was ±1 or ±2). The positive and negative values in the concluding ±ESQ table are still a bit confusing. When there are 4 positive and 4 negative relations about an element the sum is zero which makes it seem that it is not influenced. The negative and positive relations are still visible though when you look closer at the

##### 27 

matrix, but it is not visible in the graph (e.g. in figure 3.11 PuE in the graph is extremely 

dominant and not at all subordinate since it is on the x-axis, though we can clearly see in 

the matrix that is indeed effected by two other elements, PrE and NE). An idea would be 

to split the positives and negatives instead of summing. 

The participants completed the assessment in just over an hour. There was no fact 

checking, nor did anyone check any figures or statistics about jobs, taxes, population etc. 

Therefore it stays very general. To make it really work, all the facts and figures are needed. 

That would require that the plans for the different scenarios are detailed enough and 

that the time and effort for the assessment increases. But it is necessary to end up with 

valid conclusions. An example is the element individual economics. The question in the 

excel sheet regarding the relation to natural environment is: will changes in individual 

economics affect spending on e.g. private open space? How can one know if the plan 

changes individual economics? If it is related to jobs created, it is unknown where the 

employees will come from. Without any statistics valid assumptions can’t be made. 

The conclusions about M4H resulting from applying the BR2 tool in the workshop are 

very general. In the BCM (figure 3.10) we see that local institutional controls and public 

economic are dominant, which seems logical since a park function is being planned 

which is publically funded. The biggest influenced element is quality of life, which also 

seems logical since an industrial area with a closed waterfront becomes a public park. 

Also biodiversity is influenced, also due to the major function change. 

In the ESQ (figure 3.11) we see local institutional controls and public economic again as 

dominant factors. However, built environment also suddenly becomes dominant. That 

could be because we indirectly link changes in natural environment to built environment. 

The new park is to make more NE. That results in less BE. In this figure BE influences NE, 

which means less BE leads to more NE. It doesn’t work both ways, the intervention is to 

do one or the other. 

Another conclusion is that the method can also be used to get a better understanding of 

the urban system. We only assessed one redevelopment option, so the scenarios can’t be 

compared now. However, we did see which factors are dominant or subordinate and less 

or more interactive in this particular scenario. This could be helpful if we want to realize 

this plan but didn’t know where or how to start the transformation.

 Additional notes For the plan of the area, instead of assessing the alternatives as separate elements, they could be considered as subsequent land use functions in different phases of a plan (variant C, followed by D and A). It is a possibility to look at the opportunity to use the tool for sequence modelling. This could be done by assessing the situation after every phase of the plan. A mixed park/industry function can be planned to boast the image of the location before redeveloping it for housing. An example is the location of the old airstrip Valkenburg where currently the success musical Soldaat van Oranje is performed and positively brands the area for future housing developments (Smit, 2012). This will be further explored in paragraph 3.4.

### 3. The BR2 tool 

3.3 Applying BR2 on M4H workshop 

The Merwe-Vierhavens site is a difficult case, since it is not a brownfield following the 

definition in chapter 1 (p. 5). It is a combination of brownfield sites, and sites that are 

currently in use, but that will be redeveloped in the future (different time spans). The size 

of the study area is therfore larger than the average European brownfield (Oliver et. al., 

unknown, p. 7) the size is over 100 hectares. The BR2 tool was not specifically developed 

for brownfields, so the fact that M4H isn’t a brownfield shouldn’t matter for applying the 

tool. It might be hard to compare results of this case to results of the use of BR2 on the 

brownfield sites mentioned in the thesis of Leney (2008), since those are smaller in size and 

could therefore be redeveloped in one go. In this case, the tool can be used to understand 

urban systems and to see which factors are dominant when considering redevelopment. 

These factors can be starting points for the execution of the plan. 


 In this paragraph I applied the BR2 tool to assess subsequent phases with different land use functions for the redevelopment rather than different scenarios. 

 Applying the tool on the location generated several questions, especially concerning the scale of M4H and whether subsequent phasing due to the complexity that that large scale entails, will be a problem for the use of the tool. The answers to these questions are discussed at the end of this paragraph. 

1. On what scale is the BR2 tool applicable? In the examples in the thesis of Leney (2008), only single plot or single function interventions are tested in the BR2 tool. The M4H area is substantially larger and will therefore not be occupied by a single function. The context of the intervention must be modelled to test the action as a perturbation of the system. If the intervention is made on a plot in the larger area of M4H, is then that area modelled as context, or the surrounding neighbourhoods? The M4H area is after another part of the brownfield, and we want to test the effect on the urban surroundings. 

2. Is phasing included in the BR2 tool? This question is relevant for larger projects with different stages. In the thesis of Leney (2008) only small scale interventions are considered. When we talk about a first intervention, it is clear what the context is. In a second, third or next step however, that context is not so certain. We can only model the context when we assume all previous phases are executed as planned. The retrieved conclusions are then not very flexible; they are based on the assumption that the previous intervention is successful. The more stages there are, the more inflexible it is. (The urban environment is very dynamic and changes a lot). Should we then make variants for different urban contexts per phase? That would mean that how further the stage is, how more variants there are. 

3. To what extent of detail is the BR2 tool applicable? The leading diagonals seem very generic. And they have to be, in order to model the context. But until what extent does that condition limit detail? Is the BR2 tool meant for the determination of the most suitable function of the area? The way that function is designed has also an impact on whether the intervention works. Is that past the tool, or can variants of the design on that level also be modelled?

**Aim and introduction to the context of the assessment** 

The aim was to apply the BR2 tool in a “series approach” rather than a “parallel approach”. 

There are no different options assessed, but different phases within the redevelopment 

process to understand the dynamics of the urban environment within every phase. This 

way we attempt to get a better understanding of what the leading or dominant elements 

are in a specific redevelopment. 

The different options for redevelopment as addressed in the workshop in paragraph 3.3 

have formed the basis for the plan. For the entire location there is a phasing, consisting 

of phases I – V (see figure 3.13). Phase IV is the phase where the Eon/Citronas location is 

redeveloped and the phase on which we focus and apply the BR2 tool. For this there are 3 

sub phases: IV-1, IV-2 and IV-3. An overview is also given in figure 3.12. 

**Phasing** 

Figure 3.13 on the next page provides a step by step overview of the different phases 

discussed. In phase I the Merwehavens will be developed into a residential area and 

the Marconizone will become a cultural strip in cooperation with the initiative Artpark. 

Phase II will focus on the strengthening of businesses around the Marconitowers. Also 

the infrastructural node Marconiplein will be redeveloped. In phase III housing will 

be developed on the peers of the Vierhavens. In phase IV-1 gentle remediation will be 

started on the empty Citronas plot and the park along the riverside will be developed 

together with the main green infrastructure in the neighbourhood. At this stage an 

inflatable dike will be developed to protect the new residential areas. In phase IV-2 the 

vacant plots will be demolished en remediated. The old Eon and Ferro buildings will 

be turned into cultural institutions. Phase IV-3 will focus on housing developments on 

the remediated plots and the terrain next to Eon and Ferro will become a permanent

park. In phase V the most western strip of the area will be developed further in 

cooperation with the municipality of Schiedam. If the area proves to be attractive and in 

demand, new residential towers can be developed along the water. 

**Results and reflection** 

One of the first matters that were encountered when applying the tool on subsequent 

phases of a project is the problem to determine when certain relations or elements become 

significant enough to have an impact on the system. Figure 3.14 illustrates this matter. In 

the first graph we can see that by the time phase 1 reaches a level where relations and 

elements become of a certain level that they influence the system, phase 2 has already 

started. Should at that point the effects in the matrix be taken into account for phase 1 or 

for phase 2? There is a need to define at what point in time the BR2 is applied, as shown 

in the second graph. If it is applied before a next phase starts, the effects of the previous 

phase might be tangible in the next phase. If chosen to apply at the end of a phase, than 

some effects of the beginning of the next phase might be tangible in the previous phase. 

Crucial information which should already be part of the plans would be when the leasehold 

of certain plots end, what parts will be developed when and the development times of 

vegetation. To look at the plan and the relations between elements more detailed, the 

entire site could be divided into sub-plots. This would require extra time to apply the 

tool to every sub-plot. What also needs to be taken into account and what might be less 

obvious to include in planning is for example the development time of biodiversity or social 

influences. These elements are less predictable but very important in the urban system. 

It is hard to predict what the final outcome of these aspects will be, let alone the process. 

An example in this case is the relation between NE and PrE in phase IV-1. At this stage, 

the main green infrastructure in the neighbourhood is developed, but it needs time to 

develop and is therefore not yet significant enough to attract new businesses to the area.

### 3. The BR2 tool 

 3.4 Applying BR2 on M4H phases 

 Another point remains that of double relations, as explained in paragraph 3.3. As an example we can take natural environment (NE) and built environment (BE). In what way does the relation work? The plan is to implement more green as a main infrastructure through the neighbourhood and as a park. The result of this is less space for BE. But when we have vacant plots which can temporarily be used for recreation functions it seems to be the other way around (BE influences NE). The relevant question here would be if we plan NE on vacant plots or if vacant plots provide space and opportunity to use it for NE. 

 It is also related to where we place our park, under NE or BE. NE is described as green open space among others and BE as land use (which could both apply to our park function). There is a need to have a clear definitions for the elements. 

 Another example for double relations is related to the questions provided in the excel sheet to guide the user of the tool. The development of a park is a public investment and costs public money. The relation is between NE and public economic (PuE), which is defined as more public open space, more public spending. The question between local institutional control (LIC) and PuE states that LIC determines the level of public intervention, so more intervention leads to more spending. More intervention in this case is equal to more public open space, as defined at NE. It is clear that LIC has influence on the plans and thus the PuE, but isn’t the effect on PuE now double? 

 Also when we look at biodiversity (BIO) and NE and BE there is some confusion. The questions are: will the change in NE/BE lead to a change in BIO? In phase IV-3 we plan more BE but it also changes the NE which is already there at that point. It is clear that BE is the leading factor but the formulation of the question suggests that the change in NE is also active. 

 For some elements it is not clear whether specific outcomes are positive or negative. For example with institutional controls we could say that more LIC is positive because there is more protection for certain elements. We could also say that more LIC takes more effort and money to deal with certain protected elements which is negative. Therefore the interpretation of the stakeholders is vital. 

 The time duration of the application of the tool decreases after the user has applied it multiple times. Although the same reasoning is being applied for certain relations after 


##### 35 

### 3. The BR2 tool 

3.4 Applying BR2 on M4H phases 

multiple assessments. This raises the question whether all aspects of the relations are 

being covered and if important relations aren’t being forgotten. In this case the questions 

in the excel sheet can be very useful. But to prevent them from being limiting they 

should be applicable for different types of interventions, or there should be different sets 

of questions according to the type of intervention being assessed. An example of that 

limiting factor is that energy has not been considered during the entire exercise until 

coincidentally in phase IV-3 at the relation between DEM and NE. 

Sometimes questions at a certain relation trigger effects at another relation. For example, 

between quality of life (QoL) and BE it is about crime. Crime can also decrease due to 

social control, which is a relation between demographics (DEM) and BE. 

Another example is about local car journeys. The question is asked between private 

economic (PrE) and Ne, but in our case it is not commercial activity that increases car 

journeys, but residents driving from and to their houses. This question could be formulated 

at the relation between DEM and NE when there is an intervention that includes housing. 

Figures 3.15 to 3.18 on the next pages show the outcomes (BCM and ESQ) of the three 

assessed phases. In figure 3.15 we see that in the first phase NE, BE and PuE are dominant. 

That is no surprises because at this stage the demolishment and remediation of the 

Citronas plot is started which is quite large and the implementation of the main green 

infrastructure is started which is publically funded. QoL is the most subordinate, since the 

mostly concrete and privately owned land starts to get publically accessible and greener. 

In figure 3.16 we see that both PuE and BE generate a lot of positive effects. It would 

also be expected that NE would do the same, but the positive and negative effect of this 

element level each other out. The negative effect on PuE is logical because it costs a lot 

of money, but the negative effect on BE seems not logical (as mentioned before at in 

paragraph 3.3). More NE results in less BE, which is negative for BE, but it improves the 

overall quality of the area. QoL receives a lot of positive effects. 

Figure 3.17 shows that in phase IV-2 PrE and NE are most dominant. That can be explained 

due to the fact that the planned green infrastructure in phase IV-1 is now developed to 

such an extent that it has effects on the system. The dominance of PrE can be explained

 by the attractive force of that developed NE and by the transformation of the old Eon and Ferro building into cultural facilities and institutions, which are (partly) privately owned. BIO is the most subordinate, probably mostly due to the development of NE. Figure 3.18 shows that even though PrE is dominant, it is being influenced negatively. This can be explained by looking at the (large) companies which are leaving the site. Also PuE and LIC are influenced negatively, mainly due to the costs of the development of public space and due to lost tax incomes of leaving companies. BIO, BE, QoL and NE are being influenced very positively. 

 Figure 3.19 shows that DEM and BE are dominant, which is because in phase IV-3 new residential developments are realized. Figure 3.20 shows that NE, BIO and PrE are affected negatively. The first two lose space due to the new development and the latter (in the context) suffers from competition from new businesses which are attracted by the new housing developments. 

 There are no real surprises in the outcome of these assessments. The question is whether that is due to the generic information and the lack of details or due to the fact that the assessment is done by the same person who developed the plan and (unconsciously) influences the reasoning. Both have already been argued to be true. Another factor could be that the questions in the generic matrix excel file are steering reasoning and limiting the exploration of other and more relations. 

 A practical note is that when multiple elements have the same value and thus the same place in the C,E-chart, the name of the elements overlap and become unreadable. 

 Now, the questions at the the beginning of the paragraph will be addressed. 

1. On what scale is the BR2 tool applicable? During a phased project of a large scale, we’re looking at one plot (or one area) at the time within the context of its immediate area, which in this case is the rest of the M4H area. This area is still an active industrial site. The redevelopment will in the first phases not affect the urban context outside the industrial context and therefore the BR2 tool will probably not be useful during those phases. The tool could be applied during further stages of the plan.

3.4 Applying BR2 on M4H phases 

2. Is phasing included in the BR2 tool? 

The tool can be applied for a phased plan. The comments regarding the first phases are 

stated at the previous question. For the further stages (we want to redevelop the entire 

area) there are different options. We can use the tool to look at the plan at certain time 

intervals, or per phased area (subareas that are delineated in a phased plan), or look at 

the entire site before and after. This poses difficulties. When we look at time intervals, 

different phases overlap. It might be hard to tell when a relation becomes relevant and 

when it affects what (figure 3.14). The same occurs when we look at the plan per phased 

area. Looking at the entire site before and after has both advantages and disadvantages. 

It skips everything what is happening in between, so the effects during the entire process 

(which will probably be at least 20 years) are not taken into account. On the other hand, 

when finished, the effects of the redevelopment on the context can be seen clearer. 

Depending on the project it has to be decided what is the best solution for that specific case. 

3. To what extent of detail is the BR2 tool applicable? 

The method is already hard to use as it is, trying to add more layers of detail in it (more 

detailed leading diagonals) will make things much more difficult. On the other hand, 

they also might make thing easier, since the relation between more distinguished 

things are much clearer than when the terms are very broad. This needs further testing. 


 In this chapter the design for the M4H area will be presented (paragraph 4.2). The design process is not a structured and streamlined one. Firstly, some idea sketches will be presented as a continuation of the analysis, followed by some additional ideas. After that, the different ideas will be chronologically ordered to have an overview of the actual process. In this timeline we can see where and if there is a link with the BR2 tool. The subzones of the area are identified in paragraph 2.2 (figure 2.3, p. 10). 

 First idea sketches The sketches below follow the analysis from paragraph 2.2. They present challenges and opportunities and form guidelines to steer the final design.

 The idea was to give the waterfront back to the city. To give the waterfront a greater attractivity to the rest of the city and region it can be combined with a tidal park. A park in the Marconi strip could be the bridge from surrounding neighbourhoods towards the tidal park between the West point and the Citronas point. 

 In order to create better accessibility for slow traffic, the borders that the edges form need to be crossed. This way the area will be better reachable from the surrounding neighbourhoods as from the public transport hub Marconiplein. Main facilities and key locations need to be easily connected in this new slow traffic network. De Plantage is a nice park to bridge the gap to the facilities of Schiedam.

 The piers of the Merwehavens can be redeveloped from the start, since leasehold, soil contamination and current facilities in the neighbourhood permit it. The piers have good dimensions for low-rise row housing. The waterfront can either be the backyard of the buildings or the street side. 

 To protect the area from high water, a new dike can be created. It could use the highly contaminated soil of the Citronas point and create a floating community on the former point. This dike is a short line between parts of the current dike, making the total length shorter and thus the risk of a breach smaller. The new dike creates an inner dike and an outer dike area which needs adjusted buildings and public space. 

 The area can be divided according to location characteristics and redevelopment opportunities. The west strip remains a business park next to the Schiedam business park. The Marconi strip can transform into a cultural park initiated by Artpark. The Marconiplein zone remains an office and facilities zone feeded by the transport hub Marconiplein. The piers of the area are suitable for residences and the challenge is to redevelop the Citronas point and the Eon zone.

### 4. The design 

 4.1 Design process 

 A workshop for the redevelopment of the area at the municipality of Rotterdam led to a housing plan for the Merwe piers. The old foundations could be used for new housing blocks and a new floating or lightly constructed boulevard could be built to also accommodate cables and pipes, separated from trees and vegetation. The idea was based on the idea that Eon would switch to geothermal energy and tidal energy could form an additional power source. 

 The workshop with the BR2 tool led to the idea to focus on the Eon zone and the Citronas point. The rest of the area has clear potential but for the highly contaminated area of the Eon/Citronas there is not an obvious plan. The idea is to use the industrial heritage as a katalyst to upgrade the area by forming a cultural park. The transformation goes slowly and is a combination of soft remediation and temporary use. 

 Soil contamination and leasehold of the plots are two important factors for the order of development through time. Plots which are available and only little contaminated can be developed almost immediately. More contaminated plots can be remediated (softly) and developed in a later stage.

### 4. The design 

4.1 Design process 

 To ensure flood protection in the area the tips of the piers can be formed into dikes, with mobile barriers in the water between the piers. This is easier to integrate into the phasing of the plan than a new dike on land. 

 In order to experience the water more, canals can be laid through the area which fill up with water during high tide. This way the tidal movement will become a part of the identity of the area and symbolize the connection between the city and the water. In case of extreme high water, the barriers mentioned before will close and the tidal movement will in that case no longer be visible in the canals. 

 The concept is to build a green infrastructure (which also provides room for slow traffic) from the first stage. It forms a network between key locations through the area. These locations will be developed in different stages and slowly but surely the entire network becomes more vast. When the image of the area is improved more housing can be developed.

### 4. The design 

 4.1 Design process 


The timeline on the left page shows the progress of the design and in what stage the 

BR2 tool played a role. After analysis some first design ideas were formed. They led to 

the conclusion that a large part of the area has potential for redevelopment. The design 

stagnated due to the urge to apply the BR2 tool to the process. Different land-uses spread 

over the entire area and implemented on different moments in time made the combination 

of BR2 and M4H difficult. The challenge of both applying the tool to a large project and 

making a redevelopment plan for the Eon/Citronas zone led to the decision to apply the 

tool to only that specific location. The different options considered during the workshop 

were eventually applied as subsequent phases of land-use instead of evaluating them as 

alternative plans. In that respect the tool (coincidentally) formed the basis of the design 

plan.

 This chapter forms the conclusion of applying the BR2 tool in the field of urban planning and design by testing it on the urban design case of the Merwe-Vierhavens in Rotterdam. 

 Applicability in the field Getting acquainted with the tool was a long process of reading and doing research. However, in order to use the generic matrix the tool can be understood in a short time frame (during the workshop described in paragraph 4.3 the tool was explained to the participants in ten minutes). The excel sheet of the generic matrix is well organized and easy to use. Identifying and valuing relations between elements is based on expert knowledge and needs to be done in a group of stakeholders and expert with knowledge about the location and subjects in order to get valid results. It forms a way of communication between disciplines which makes it a communicational tool. If applied by a single person or a small group of people (with limited interests and/or limited knowledge) the method would be subjective. The most ideal situation would be to have two workshops, one to create a site specific matrix and one to assess different options for redevelopment. Creating a custom made matrix in the field of urban planning and design has not been done in this report and needs further research. 

 While understanding the generic matrix is easy to do, applying it poses some challenges. When applying the tool, there is a strong need for a discussion leader whom understands the tool very well and can make sure the reasoning is consistent throughout the exercise. There are small details that can aid that cause. One is to set a strict boundary for the site and the context. If the situation of the context is being taken into account in one mechanism, it also should be in others. There also need to be set boundaries for external influences. In the workshop for example, some relations were being considered as a result of the intervention, whilst others were considered as a result of existing laws. The reasoning should be ambiguous, that way results of different relations can be better compared to each other. In the current generic matrix however, unambiguous definitions of elements and mechanisms between mechanisms also impede that. In the current situation there are relations defined as a quantity whilst others are defined as a quality. The definitions should be changed in the tool or the discussion leader has to make sure strict agreements are made regarding this. There also need to be made agreements about to what extent indirect relations can be taken into account. I a lot of situation indirect relations lead to circle reasoning, which needs to be avoided. 

### 5. Evaluation and conclusion 


 x 

The excel sheet itself provides questions to guide the user when identifying relations. 

These questions are sometimes limiting participants in thinking about the relations. It is 

also confusing since there are a lot of different types of land-use in redevelopment plans. 

The tool could provide different sets of questions according to the type of redevelopment 

being assessed. The colouring of the tool is also confusing at times and would work better 

if adjusted. For some elements it is not clear whether specific outcomes are positive or 

negative. This needs to be agreed on by the stakeholders. 

After filling in the matrix, it would be good to review the exercise one more time to rule out 

inconsistencies. When there are no detailed facts and figures about the redevelopment 

plans the results of the assessment remain very general. In order to obtain valid and useful 

conclusions, the plans need to be worked out to a detailed scale before they’re assessed 

with the BR2 tool. It still remains an exercise of doing assumptions and predictions, but 

expert knowledge and sufficient information can provide a solid reasoning. 

The results of the valuing (ESQ chart) can sometimes be misleading. When an element 

has both negative and positive influences on other elements the summing can result in 

a value of zero influence. In the ESQ matrix the separate values are visible but in the ESQ 

chart they are not. A solution would be to split the result into positive influences and 

negative influences. 

**Applicability on large scale projects** 

The Merwe-Vierhavens is a very large area which is partly still active as an industrial area. 

The complexity of the area poses a big challenge. The site cannot be redeveloped at once, 

due to the size and economic situation, the market, the leaseholds, contamination etc. The 

plan will be implemented in different stages. During the first phases the redevelopment 

will not affect the urban context outside the still active industrial zone and therefore the 

BR2 tool will probably not be useful, since there is no need of assessing the influences 

of the redevelopment on the industrial zone. It could however be possible to use the 

tool the other way around, by testing the influences of the industrial site on different 

redevelopment options. This needs further testing. 

We can use the tool to look at the plan at certain time intervals, or per phased area 

(subareas that are delineated in a phased plan), or look at the entire site before and 

### 5. Evaluation and conclusion

### 5. Evaluation and conclusion 

 after. This poses difficulties. When we look at time intervals, different phases overlap. The effects of an intervention in one phase could be tangible in a later phase. In order to prevent relations to be taken into account in multiple phases the phases need to be delimited. The point in time where the tool is applied also needs to be defined carefully. To be able to delimit phases, crucial information like when the leasehold of plots end, what parts will be developed when and the development times of vegetation should be known and part of the plan. The same occurs when we look at the plan per phased area. It also means that the tool needs to be applied many times and a lot of stakeholder workshops are needed for that. Looking at the entire site before and after has both advantages and disadvantages. It skips everything what is happening in between, so the effects during the entire process (which will probably be at least 20 years) are not taken into account. On the other hand, when finished, the effects of the redevelopment on the context can be seen clearer. Depending on the project it has to be decided what the best solution for that specific case is. 

 Another challenge for a site like M4H is to determine what the context is for a certain intervention. In some phases (when the redevelopment is in the middle of the site) the larger site itself forms (part of ) the context, while in a later stage (more to the edge of the area) also the surrounding neighbourhoods are part of the equation. To avoid confusion and inconsistencies the context per phase needs to be determined. 

 Personal reflection For me, it took a lot of time to understand the tool. This was partly because I focussed on making a specific tailor-made matrix for the M4H location. This posed a lot of questions and further research, which, in hindsight, delayed the process of the research as a whole. When I finally got to use the generic matrix for the first time on the Hofbogen case (paragraph 3.2), I realized that using the generic matrix on my own was already a huge challenge. A lot of questions arose during this and it became apparent that the tool had to be applied during a (simulated) workshop with stakeholders and experts (paragraph 3.3). The workshop presented new questions and challenges, which all have been discussed before, but it also steered the design (accidentally). Working with the tool made it clear that it would be too complex to apply BR2 to the entire site, and therefore the decision was made to focus on the Eon/Citronas zone, since this was the area which was least obvious for redevelopment (due to contaminations etc.) Also the proposed alternative plans of the workshop could be combined into one plan, implemented in different stages 


 x 

### 5. Evaluation and conclusion 

through time. So the tool contributed to the design even though it is not meant to. I 

made the mistake of wanting to design with the tool which led to a delay in the process. 

Looking back, it is clear that BR2 is a decision making tool and should be applied on 

certain moments in the design process. The design itself has no connections to the tool, 

other than the decision of which plan will be developed further, which is made with BR2. 

Given these findings, the BR2 tool itself can be improved and the guiding of the user 

needs to be improved. There is a manual being developed at the University of Nottingham. 

Hopefully this will lead to a clearer process and a better use of the BR2 tool.

Sub regions: Vierhavens 

- Marconistrip 

- Merwehavens 

**Vierhavens** 

Characteristics: Image is inspiring, free and rough. Monumental buildings with 

 cultural historic value. Warehouses and harbor related functions. Unused buildings, feeling of insecurity; closed off image and lack of liveliness. 

Landowner: Largely municipality (OBR, Ontwikkelingsbedrijf Rotterdam). 

 Mostly in leasehold until 2025 or later. 

Challenges: Nuisance limits and other restrictions prevent transformation. 

 There is soil, water and ground contamination. Some private, non-accessible roads. A lot of cargo transport and no separate room for bicycles and pedestrians. Several quays are outdated. Energy transition and sustainable (urban) water management. 

Intended 

transformation: Mix of harbor related functions and urban functions. Location for 

 companies related to delta technology. Water for demo floating structures and energy extraction out of river water. Room for small companies to start transformation. Suitable companies to settle are: 

- Focused on water, energy and sustainability 

- Innovative, leader firms 

- Added value to Rotterdam Climate Campus (RCC) network 

- Sustainable in image 

- Able to create jobs 

- Able to fit within the mixed, green urban character of the neigh- bourhood 

 In the northern part of the area, and the southeastern corner, high quality residential areas will arise with 1300 to 1400 dwellings. A direct link between dwellings and the campus is intended.

 More space for pedestrians and bicycles. Condition for this in tensive transformation is that existing harbor activities are moved (to the Waaland Eem-harbor). 

 Policy goals: Transformation must contribute to secure the position of the Mainport Rotterdam as a vital economic settling area. Also add to the image of the attractive working city. Local small businesses as a connection with surrounding neighborhoods. Reconnect the city to the water. New development must be sustainable: 

- In mobility: waterbus, electrical transport over land, structured public transport, room for bicycles and pedestrians. 

- CO2 neutral, H2O neutral, zero waste, climate proof building. Intended result: Attractive and high quality living and working environment. RCC as central party. International study area for energy transition and water management. Sustainable dwellings. Accessible area that reconnects city to the river. Transformation strategy: Heavy involvement of the market. Short term program should fit long term goals. Short term: innovative leisure economy, food, catering and limited workshops. Around Keilehaven: innovative businesses and leisure economy. Use the development of new dwellings in Tussendijken neighbourhood and the Dakpark mall to extend development to the Keilehaven. In transition area, shopping and leisure. Infrastructure, route over Dakpark to waterfront at the Katoen veem building, where a waterbus stop will be realized. 

 From 2015 until 2037, movement of juice cluster to (presumably) Waal-harbour. In this period 1335 apartments will be built. Expansion of room for offices and businesses. Remediation needed for the entire area. Most contaminated is the old gas factory, sanitation until 2029. Investment in infrastructure, bridge over the Vierhavensstraat.

Sustainability: Reuse of building materials (also decreases transport) and “recy

 cling boulevard” around Keilehaven to test street lighting etc. Connecting chocolate melter to rest heat of eon. Connect warehouses to the heat net so they don’t have to use ammoniac for cooling any longer. Amphibiotic building, raising ground level (on building level) to ensure water safety. Raising the entire area is not an option, nor is moving the dike. 

Phasing: 2010 – 2011 Redesign of Marconiplein. 

 2010 – 2014 Leisure realization. 2010 – 2016 Sustainability investments (noise measures eon etc.). 2011 – 2034 Offices (most part until 2014), remediation necessary for: NSI terrain, Ferro, Katoenveem, Haka, Chefaro, Juice warehouses, Rotterdam retail center. 2012 Start remediation of gas factory. Largest part be tween 2020 and 2029. 2013 – 2014 Social facilities. 2014 Pedestrian boulevard and public space Keilehaven. 2016 Accessibility improved. 2016 Bridge over Vierhavensstraat. 2023 – 2032 1335 apartments realized. 2033 – 2034 Social facilities and leisure. 2034 – 2036 Shopping. 

**Marconistrip** 

Characteristics: Small strip of land, should be seen together with Merwehavens to 

 form Merwestad (Merwe city) in the future. Old shunting area Warehouses, partly empty, partly rented (also artists’ workshops). Long vistas towards the river and RDM terrain on the south bank. 

Landowner: Municipality, Real estate by OBR/Havenbedrijf. 

Challenges: Neglected area. Social insecurity. Criminality. Polluted soil.

 Intended transformation: Together with Merwehavens 3000 dwellings. Until 2015 catalyst in transformation from harbour to urban space. Free zone for businesses. Transform into a modern urban area, related to the Merwehavens. Until 2015, temporary functions to improve the image of the area and the branding. Temporary use will expose the intrinsic quality. The area will be lively and safe. Policy goals & intended result: To secure the area won’t be any more neglected, short term inter ventions are needed. On the short term (until 2015) the long term transformation will be initiated by improving the image and branding. The theme ‘nature and culture’ will be leading in the short term interventions. Busi nesses in creative sector and urban farming will be facilitated. On the long term (2015 – 2040) this area together with the Mer wehavens will become a high quality residential area (partly float ing). Sustainability is a key precondition. The dwellings must be self-sufficient on energy. Green facilities will be realized. Dwellings will be in the middle and higher segment to bind more highly educated people to the city. Transformation strategy: The rough image will be kept and (minimally) redesigned as free zone. The area will be made accessible and safe. The east and west part will be used first. Old warehouses can serve as exposition space, workshops, space for catering industry. The middle part will be used for urban farming and glasshouses. This part will also be the connection between the neighbourhood north of the dike and Merwestad. Six themes in the transformation to free zone: 

1. Culture and nature and crossing borders Temporary functions without a strict urban plan. Dynamo func tions, temporary activities attract long-term functions (energy transition and climate adaptation). Use of cultural heritage as strength.

2. Improve accessibility The outer dike area will be made better accessible, but safe. 

3. Environment and sustainability The users an inhabitants of the outer dike area will be self-suffi cient on water and energy. 

4. Changing zoning plan Current plan only allows business and industry parks. 

5. Cost effective leases to temporary functions Temporary functions will only get a short lease to ensure long- term development. These short term leases must be cost efficient. 

6. Removal of harbour related functions After 2015 harbour related functions will be moved to the Waal and Eem harbour to create room for residential areas. After 2015, the long-term (permanent) redevelopment together with the Merwehavens will be realized. 3800 floating and non-floating houses will we developed. There will be a mix of living and working in a high density. The necessary heightening of the Schiedamsedijk gives opportunity for innovative dike strengthening in combination with an urban program. 

Sustainability: The possibility to place second-hand wind mills (40m). 

 Integrate the dike in the area. 

Phasing: 2010 – 2011 8000m2 business park Marconi free zone will be

 Merwehavens Characteristics: Typical harbour area. Warehouses. Three harbour basins. Peers used for fruit cluster. Inaccessible area. Fruit cluster, gas station, distil cluster (Schiedam), glass factory (Schiedam). Landowner: 46 hectares, mostly Havenbedrijf. In leasehold (biggest users are Van Uden [4,3 hectares] and Seabrex [29 hectares]). When leasehold ends, ownership goes to municipality. Challenges: Nuisance from fruit cluster are a problem for redevelopment. Intended transformation: The most important part is after 2020. A high quality urban envi ronment with 3000 houses in the middle and higher segment. Seabrex wants to modernize and intensify. The Waal and Eem harbour are more suitable for this (also close to A15). Policy goals & intended result: Create an urban area that connects to the Vierhavens and the Marconistrip, but more importantly, forms a connection with surrounding neighbourhoods. By implementing a high quality residential area in a current harbour, the entire district will get a quality impulse. With high quality, sustainable housing in the middle and higher segment is meant. The 3000 houses are to be realized in a mix of apartments and low-rise. The peers will be connected with bridges, also to form an important new bicycle connection along the river. For facilities, the city center of Schiedam is nearby. Merwestad can provide other facilities for the entire district, such as docking places for boats and water sports clubs. Transformatio strategy: Realize Merwestad from 2020 on together with the definitive transformation of the Marconistrip. The strategy is to take measure before that to make sure it will be possible. The fruit cluster is an obstruction, not only for the area itself, but also to the Vierhavens due to nuisance. The leasehold of some grounds are until 2050, so early termination is necessary. Movement of Seabrex in 2014 if possible.

 Attractive city. The city and the region want to enhance their attractiveness by offering a larger variety of work and living environments. The Stadshavens can play a key role in this. This also fits the ambition to realize at least 80% of expansion within city limits. For Merwe-Vierhavens this means: 

 Development in 20 to 30 years into new water oriented city district with 4500 to 6500 houses and businesses and services related to the Clean Tech Delta. High sustainability ambitions and trendsetting temporary uses for plots which are waiting to be redeveloped. 

 Sustainable Stadshavens: 1. Building energy neutral 

2. Building climate proof 

3. Development on and around the water 

4. Reuse of existing materials and products 

5. Producing the least possible amount of pollution, for     example through sustainable mobility 

6. A green environment 

7. Human scale as starting point 

8. Developing from a cultural historic perspective 

9. Sustainable operation en management of real estate 

10. Knowledge about sustainability as economic engine

 Summary 2011 structural vision Stadshavens

Stadshavens has three focus groups: Pioneers (innovators), trendsetters (early adopters) 

and trend followers (early majority). Pioneers are starting entrepreneurs, artists’ collectives 

and clients for building their own home. They make and create conditions themselves. 

They need space and freedom. Facilities need to be mobile and flexible. Trendsetters are 

new communities, small enterprises and volunteers from surrounding neighbourhoods. 

They need the first part of the (small scale) facilities. Private and collective parties are 

initiators for real estate development on appealing locations. A combination between 

working and living is attractive. Accessibility needs to be sorted at basic level. Most 

important is perspective on better accessibility in the future. Trend followers are service 

focused and status sensitive civilians and entrepreneurs, and active young people looking 

for an attractive working, learning and leisure environment. They want to board in an area 

that is prepared for them. The image is clear and appealing, houses can be built on a big 

scale. Facilities reach the level planned. Accessibility and parking need to be in order. 

Stadshavens is meant for companies that: 

- Produce clean 

- Contribute via their products and services to a sustainable harbour city 

- Have sustainable added value for the logistic flows within the harbour 

- Contribute to the shift from a fossil fuel powered economy towards a     renewable energy based economy 

**Merwe-Vierhavens** 

International experimental garden for innovative energy supply and water management, 

for both residential areas as working areas. Scientists, advisors and engineering firms 

integrate their knowledge and expertise here. There is enough space in the harbour to 

experiment with new concepts. Also other pioneers, such as artists, urban farmers and 

entrepreneurs in manufacturing are attracted by the inspiring environment where the 

harbour is still functioning. A new water focused district arises which allows experimenting 

for sustainable urban redevelopment. Retrieving an urban waterfront. 

Phasing: Until 2015 The first ground rights are being transferred from the 

 harbour to the municipality. Necessary investments are made to attract pioneers to the area. Marconistrip is transformed into free zone.

After reading about the method, some questions arose. These questions are formulated 

in this paragraph, as are the answers provided by Matthew Ashmore. The regular text 

refers to the PhD-thesis of Leney (2008) and the text in italics are the posed questions. 

After the questions some general comments are mentioned. 

[page 126, paragraph 2] The challenge is to ensure that everything relevant within that 

boundary is present within the model. 

1. How can you best handle or manage this? Consequences of perturbations on aspects 

which were not indicated as relevant are not included; these could also indirectly influence 

aspects within the boundary. 

2. A relation between components is filled in in the matrix. What if there are multiple 

relations? What if the relation is positive AND negative? How can this be modelled in the matrix? 

Example: re-use of brown water > a lot of nutrients that could enhance biodiversity (positive), 

but it can also make strong species more dominant over others (negative for biodiversity). 

[page 139, last paragraph] Within brownfield redevelopment, although there is no 

coherent body of theory on brownfield redevelopment and regeneration, theory does 

exist but is spread throughout the literature of many disciplines and is generally not 

readily available to those who redevelop brownfield sites. A REMIT/RESPONSE based 

approach provides a means of synthesising this disjointed body of theory into a form that 

is readily available to those involved in the redevelopment of brownfield sites, the generic 

interaction matrix. 

3. Who will synthesize this? Will the generic matrix be suitable for all brownfield 

redevelopment plans? If not and the matrix has to be created for each project, will there be a 

coherent body of theory created along with the BR2 tool? Or does it have to be synthesized by 

each person using the tool? 

[page 212] Example Basford Food Superstore. An increase in traffic has been shown to 

have a significant systemic effect on urban areas which can result in loss of flora and 

fauna, adverse health effects, the creation of ‘fresh food deserts’, increased carbon dioxide 

emissions, adverse economic impacts and even flash flooding. 

4. Where do these systemic effects show in the matrix (figure 88, page 214)? Is it in the 

value of the relation (-2 in this case)? If so, is a scale from +2 to -2 sufficient then? The table 

### Appendix C 

Q&A about BR2 tool 


x 

 in the appendices [page 300, cell 3,4] only states: Significant increase in traffic due to people driving to the new supermarket. But not why it’s valued as -2, should the table be extended? 

 [page 175, figure 67] Example Radford 

5. All conclusions, like those of the critical interactions, are based on the leading terms that are defined. When critical terms are missing, conclusions may not be valid, they only reflect on the relation between the chosen terms. Site can be dominant when assessed with urban area, economics and policy, but might be subordinate when another aspect is added. How to best deal with this? (Related to first question) 

6. The examples talk about mono-functional interventions/perturbations. Is the tool applicable for mixed-use interventions? 

7. The leading diagonal terms are very broad or general. Is it possible to define more detailed terms in a later stage of designing? Till what extend of detail is the BR2 tool applicable? 

 [page 223, second paragraph] Advantage: BR2 tool does not require the same level of knowledge about each aspect of the brownfield redevelopment system. 

8. Why not? Is that not needed to determine the relations and especially to value the relations? 

 [page 224, second paragraph] Similarly information about the impact of brownfield redevelopment is not necessarily easily available to those managing or assessing redevelopment projects. Brownfield REMIT/RESPONSE could help to overcome this problem by making the relevant aspects of urban theory available to brownfield redevelopment practitioners in the form of generic interaction matrices. 

9. If the generic matrix is there to guide planners and to synthesize the disjointed body of theory into a form that is readily available, and doesn’t require the same level of knowledge about each aspect, wouldn’t these matrices then create very black and white ideas? Does “demographics” always have a negative relation on “quality of life”? How do you prevent the user from blindly taking the outcomes as facts? 

10. On what scales is the tool applicable? The examples show one building or one-function perturbations. What if there is an urban ensemble with multiple functions? Do you then 

### Appendix C 

 Q&A about BR2 tool 


 x 

need different models with different context? 

11. The object to be redeveloped is related to the urban context. But what if the brownfield 

is larger than the object itself (for example one factory in an old harbour area; Merwe

Vierhavens Rotterdam)? Is the industrial harbour context then modelled and the surrounding 

residential not relevant? And what if the rest of the area will also be redeveloped, outcomes 

might be uncertain. How do we deal with that regarding our plans for the factory? What 

context to use? 

General comments 

Relations seem sometimes very general: Development has positive impact on individual 

economic (new jobs and increased incomes) [page 209]. We need to know if educational 

level and aspirations of residents match the new businesses. This determines till what 

extend the population will benefit (employees from outside of the region might be 

attracted, which leads to an increase of traffic). 

A lot of questions arise when reading about BR2 tool and trying to understand it. But 

slowly it becomes clearer. Not always very apparent, though. Perhaps a manual focussed 

on spatial planners? Or one that is easily understood by all stakeholders? 

Answers by Matthew Ashmore 

1. I think my answer to many of your questions will be “by having a good cross section 

of stakeholder involvement”. I think it’s the only way that the majority of potential issues 

can be anticipated, though a knowledgeable local regulator would be the first on the list. 

2. You could try to identify a particular factor that is most dominant, or give some 

kind of composite answer for the relationship – in your example, if you’ve constructed a 

wetland to deal with it then the area will have at least one more species in the area. Ideally 

in a more developed tool, if it seems in important/intractable issue, then the component 

should be split into the separate aspects that produce the different responses (I’m 

considering how I might put this in a future iteration of the tool now). 

3. Again, initially at least, it will be down to the stakeholders and their experience. 

The idea behind a generic tool I guess is partly to begin this process and perhaps include

Q&A about BR2 tool 


x 

 increasing depth and experience with future updates. 

4. Remember e.g. -2 should not be viewed as a numerical value, more of a value judgement (I know this is exactly how it is used as in a C,E diagram, which is another reason why these diagrams, beyond the binary charts, should be used with caution). I think in this case, in the location discussed, a value judgement was made (by a single research student rather than a cross section of stakeholders) – I’ve heard at least one case in the US where residents wanted a supermarket in such a situation because the area already was a fresh food desert and this would actually cut traffic as people wouldn’t have to travel as far. 

5. See answer 1. 

6. Yes if you include e.g. numbers of dwellings, jobs/types of employment which may be may be created. You could potentially create scenarios according to the proportion of each and look at the effects of each. 

7. if the site is simple enough, these components may be enough, perhaps bigger/ more complex sites may require these to be expanded – I’m thinking about a more complex tool now. 

8. Sorry, can’t quite see what was being got at here. 

9. This is a problem with all tools and methods in the field, many I see include different assumptions a fudge factors and these tend not to be easily seen in the outputs. The best you can hope for is a reasonably transparent process so all stakeholders have a say in how the decision was made. Any tool like this is open to misuse, again, it’s about trust, transparency and having a good stakeholder cross section involved. 

10. The UK we’re trying it out on (retrospectively) is Markham Vale, a former coalmine now an industrial area which they’re hoping will eventually provide 5000 jobs, and you could imagine using a similar methodology for e.g. comparing several sites in a country for a new international airport, say, so it should scale to any appropriate size, but obviously the complexity may also increase. Ultimately, the technique offers a way for all stakeholders 

### Appendix C

to get their views across, no method is ever going to be absolutely objective or complete. 

11. You’ll still need transport links, workforce etc., if you’re looking at one plot within 

a bigger mega site say, then how the brownfield surroundings will affect the finished 

redeveloped may factor in the analysis. At Markham, I’m trying to set the system area as 

that within a commutable distance/time (given the nature of the likely jobs). If it’s one site 

within a functioning industrial area then it might be one or two aspects of the site making 

it unattractive and a process like this isn’t really warranted. You also have to look at how 

incentives for companies to take on the site affect similar sites nearby, eg Markham has a 

system of incentives for manufacturing companies to take up plots, but what if a company 

uses this merely to relocate a few miles?

 The workshop to simulate stakeholder participation took place on 29th of July 2014.

 Context: 

 Linda Maring (Sr. project leader urban land and water management, Deltares) Ignace van Campenhout (Advisor Subsurface, GIS & 3D, Engineering office for city development Rotterdam) Fransje Hooimeijer (Assistant Professor Environmental Technology and Design, TU Delft) Sien Kok (Intern urban land and water management, Deltares & student MSc Earth Sciences and Economics, VU Amsterdam) Jelle van Gogh (Intern urban land and water management, Deltares & student MSc Urbanism, TU Delft) Myself, Nirul Ramkisor (Intern urban land and water management, Deltares & student MSc Urbanism, TU Delft) 

 The aim of the workshop was to assess multiple options for redeveloping the Merwe-Vierhavens (M4H) site in Rotterdam with a group of people that could function as stakeholders and experts. The time for this workshop was 90 – 120 minutes. 

- Introduction BR2 tool and generic matrix 

- Introduction M4H location 

- Assessing one option of redevelopment with the generic matrix The M4H site is still and active harbor area. However, plans are already being made for when the port related industries cease activities on their current location. The leasehold of the plots will not end simultaneously. In the first steps of redevelopment, the plot lies within the context of the active harbor area (figure C6) and the plot seems commercially viable - the only restraint is the operating eon power plant. Therefore using the BR2 tool is not very apparent. In a later stage, the area around this power plant (phase 4, figure C7) will be redeveloped within the context of the earlier developed phases – dwellings, offices and businesses.
