 In 1892 the area had a dominant polder structure and a dike to protect the land. 

 In 1929 the outer dike area is transformed in to a harbour.

 Nowadays the area knows a mixture of functions. The most important once are the fruit and juices (fruit en sappen) industries and the EON factory. 

 Most of the area is owned by the harbour company, and a smaller part by the municipality. Both are leasing the ground to other parties.

 There are a few monuments in the Merwevierhaven area, and some buildings are on the list of becoming a monument in the near future. There are other, non-monumental, buildings that show the character of the area as well. 

 There is a big variation in the expiration dates of the ground leases. The longest leases are that of the EON factory and of the eastern harbour arms.

 The Merwevierhaven area is an outer dike area, so the height of the surface level is very important. Most of the roads are higher than the rest of the open surface. The EON factory is on higher ground then its surroundings. 

 The risk map shows the current risks for the Merwevierhaven area. The most important one to take in account is the non-building zone from the river the Maas.

 The industry in the Merwevierhaven area produces a lot of noise that causes disturbance for the surroundings. The danger of deafness occurs when a person is exposed to an ongoing noise level of 80 dB (www.arbounie.nl). 

 The big road on the north part of the Merwevierhaven area is very noisy, but the noise does not go far into the area. The noise of the road is not ongoing, because it depends on the traffic passing by.

 The amount of NO2 measured in the air is no threat to the Merwevierhaven area, expect for a little bit in the north-eastern part, at the big road crossing, Marconiplein. 

 The air quality measured with particulate matters shows almost the same story as that of the NO2 air quality. Less quality air at Marconiplein, but nothing threatening in the Merwevierhaven area.

 The Merwevierhaven area is very industrial and has almost no greenery. Trees are only to be found along the road that discloses the area in the north. 

 The map on the left shows a research of the potential for urban farming in the city of Rotterdam. The Merwevierhaven area is very suitable for aquaponics; a food production system that combines conventional aquaculture (raising aquatic animals in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) in a symbiotic environment (en.wikipedia.org).

#### Urban agriculture potentials

There are a lot of urban farming initiatives in Rotterdam. Two big once in the Merwevierhaven area are ‘Uit Je Eigen Stad’ and ‘Dakpark’. 

#### Urban farming initiatives 

#### Restaurants within 3 km Location food retailers 

Because the Merwevierhaven area is close to the centre of Rotterdam, there are a lot of restaurants in the surrounding the urban agriculture could produce for. 

 Most of the large food retailers and farmer’s markets are in the city centre, close to the Merwevierhaven area.

#### Marconistrip 

Source: De Graaf, P., RUIMTE voor STADSLANDBOUW in ROTTERDAM, 2011. 

 The urban farming initiative ‘Uit Je Eigen Stad’ is situated on the Marconistrip, in the north of the Merwevierhaven area. The initiative at the Marconistrip is very important for the city of Rotterdam because of; 

- The use of vacant land and buildings, 

- Creating places for learning and working, 

- A visible fresh food production, 

- Accessible greenery, 

- The closing of production cycles, 

- The use of residual waste.

 Most groundwater contamination in the Merwevierhaven area is focused on one spot. There is no information available about the EON site, but we can assume that the groundwater in that area is rather contaminated. 

 The soil contamination in the Merwevierhaven area is more spread out than the groundwater contamination, because of the industrial character of the area. The biggest contamination is on the same spot as the groundwater contamination.

 The infiltration in the Merwehaven is more than 1mm a day. The rest of the Merwevierhaven area has just a little bit infiltration a day. 

 In the ground there is a chaotic system of cables and pipes. Most cables and pipes run under the streets. The same story here is that we do not know what there is to be found in the subsurface of the EON company area.

 Gas and heating pipes are not to be found in the whole project area. There are just a few that extend into the harbour arms. 

 The sewage and water pipes are better structured through the area. There is just one harbour arm that is not connected to the network.

 After testing 6 versions on the 5 most relevant topics for the Merwevierhaven area found in the analysis, namely 1.archeology, 2. monuments, 3. harbour structure, 4. contamination and 

5. cables and pipes, version 6 came out as the most suitable urban form. This urban form takes all the topics into account. There is space to bring back to structure of the old dike. The mon- ument can all remain in this urban form and the so characteristic harbour structure of Rotterdam will stay intact. The contaminated soil and groundwa- ter will need to be remediated and the cables and pipes will probably need to be moved partially. So this is where the main focus of the design should be on.

# IDEAL PHASING 


###### Ideal phasing leasehold 

###### Ideal phasing remediation costs 

0 0,5 km 

 After analysing the area and the search to different urban forms, I took a look at the analyses and the consequences of the possible phasing for the redevelopment of the Merwevierhaven area. There are different things that will have an influence on the phasing, and they vary slightly from the ideal phasing sequence. I looked at the ideal phasing of 1. remediation, 2. remediation costs and 3. the leaseholds. These I conbined into the ideal phasing taking into account all three individual ideal phasings, as can be seen on the next page.

 When we combine the conclusions of the ideal phasing for the leasehold, the remediation and the remediation costs a total ideal phasing occurs as is shown on the left side of this page. This phasing was the starting point for the final design.

# Excavation 

Excavate 

New land 

Heighten 1 m 

The biggest change for the area will be the excavation and heightening of certain parts of the Merwevierhaven area. The western part will be developed in more small harbour arms instead of two big once. The harbour arms will be cut off from the rest and serve as islands. In the middle the old dike structure will be brought back to the area and serve as the connector with the DakPark. The east of the area will have some excavation as well. The docks will be detached from the land. Streets in the whole area will be 1 meter higher than the terrain of the building blocks to make room for parking 

garages and the cables and pipes. 

Excavated: 206350 m3 Heightened: 237600 m3 

0 0,5 km 


# Remediation 

 No remediation Natural attenuation Artificial wetland Natural remediation 

 Most contamination is situated in the middle area. Therefore the eastern part does not need any remediation, by redesigning this area with more greenery, the soil and groundwater will be cleaned automatically. In the western part the same will be done, but then with more concentration. The dirty soil that will be excavated will be used in the structuring of the dike. This soil will be wrapped so it cannot contaminate any other soil. The artificial wetland is a different sort of natural remediation. The areas addressed for urban agriculture will be cleaned by the use of enhanced natural attenuation aerobic. The potential of naturally present bacteria to degrade the contamination in an oxic environment is stimulated by optimizing the conditions for biological degradation. The site disturbance is low and it will take up to a few years.

 The Merwevierhaven area is divided in different sub areas. From east to west: 

1. Residential; this part will be trans- formed into a residential area orientat- ed on the waterfront. 

2. Living with water; this will be a quite but dense neighbourhood where people will live with the water and can participate in the construction of their own housing. 

3. Urban agriculture; expanding the already existing initiatives to provide for the city of Rotterdam and create a haven of nature in the busy city. 

4. Public wetland park; a sustainable and natural way of cleaning the soil with possibilities for temporary use, making people aware of the issues and creating a nice and welcoming park for the whole area. 

5. Creative industries; already existing buildings will be renovated into stu- dios for creative industries 

6. Mixed use; keeping the industrial character of the area. Businesses and residential housing along side each other.

# Functions 


# Infrastructure 

 The road structure in the Merwevierhaven area changed along with the urban form. The main roads in the north of the area will stay the main connectors, but where in the east the roads are directly connected for a good accessibility for the businesses, the islands in the western part will not be connected to the main road so easily. Here the roads on the islands will be only for inhabitants and visitors. The middle area is connected with the western and the eastern part, but from that on, it will mainly by local traffic, bikers or pedestrians enjoying the landscape. The dike will connect the area with the Dakpark so the area will be very well accessible for pedestrians and cyclists. From the top end of the middle part of the harbour a connection will be made with the water taxi to take people across the river Maas. 

0 0,5 km 


# Cables and pipes 

 During the analysis I discovered that the cables and pipes structure in the Merwevierhaven area is a mess. First of all we are not sure about the position of the cables and pipes. Second, some cables are old and not even connected to a system anymore and others suddenly stop. This means that the cables and pipes structure had to be replaced almost completely. 

 Every island will have a main utility duct walking through. Where needed this duct will split off into a smaller duct. The middle area will not need a big structure of cables and pipes, so by focusing them on the dike, the ground will be open for other developments, but still have the possibility to connect to the duct when needed. 

0 0,5 km 


 Utility Duct 

 Road Building Sewer pipes 

 Drainage pipes Electricity cables 

 Communication cables Gas pipes 

To clear out the mess in the soil and not getting the problem again, the cables and pipes will all be collected in an utility duct. These ducts are very easy to access for maintenance. To keep the site open for transformation, the utility ducts will be placed under the permeable roads, with once in a while an access point. The connection to the utility duct has to be made by the future inhabitants of the area or project developers. This way, every building or block will have the choice how to connect to the utility duct and gains freedom in designing.

# Utility Duct 


# Monuments 

 At the location of the old dike the surface level will be heightened and the dike will be brought back into the landscape. The quays are an important feature of the harbour and will remain in the new structure. This makes a difference between the old quays and the new quays what will show the rich development history of the Merwevierhaven area. All the monuments and also the buildings that will probably be listed as a monument will remain and where needed restored. A part of the old train tracks will remain in the middle area. This due to the fact that the soil will be left as it is, and this way people will be remembered to the industrial history of the area. 

0 0,5 km 


# Sustainability 

 The redevelopment of the Merwevierhaven area will be very sustainable. All the new housing will be connected to thermal storage and have green roofs. A geothermal plant will be installed as well as a water storage tank. In the eastern part the water will be cleaned before given back to the river.

# Dike 

 The large dike (4 meters high) is the main connector of the Merwevierhaven area with it’s surroundings. It is connected to the Dakpark and walk through the area with a good view over the wetlands and agricultural lands. The dike will bring the visitors to the head of the area where the area is connected with the rest of Rotterdam via a water taxi. 


# Urban Agriculture 

 Source: De Graaf, P., RUIMTE voor STADSLANDBOUW in ROTTERDAM, 2011. 

 Both sides of the dike will work together. For example, the sludge of the wetlands can be used for farming. The local treatment makes people more aware. it renders palpable to them that their effluents do matter (cradle to cradle). This area will be very important for the whole city. Locals can contribute in producing a big variation of products. 


# Artificial Wetlands 

 The main aim of this wetland will be making remediation visible and in this way be a temporary and changing landscape. Wetland areas provide vital centers for breeding, nutrient cycling, and water absorption and purification (cradle to cradle). Thereby bogs are better at soaking carbon dioxide than fully grown forrests (rijnenburg Utrecht). Storm water and waste water are channeled through a series of connected wetlands that clean them, in process lightning the load on the river (cradle to cradle). In the ‘forbidden garden’ small routes will be made to small, sustainable and temporary houses providing spaces for business, information centres and community projects.
