## Trenching Methods 

The following are general specifications for construction of a granular iron permeable reactive barrier (PRB) using various trenching methods. For specifications on biopolymer trenching method see TN 3.11. There are some details noted in the specifications that require project specific data. _This information is in [] brackets and in italics is provided as information in preparing the specification and is not intended to be incorporated in the completed specification._ 

**Description** 

The work described in this section consists of furnishing all labor, equipment, materials, and supervision for installation of a PRB using a trenching technique. 

The trenching method for a PRB involves excavating of a trench and simultaneously filling the trench with a reactive material such as granular iron or a granular iron/sand mix.

 x Connelly-GPM, Inc., 3154 S California Ave., Chicago, IL, 60608-5176 Tel: 773.247.7231 Fax: 773.247.7239 Web: http://www.connellygpm.com x Product ETI-CC1004 (-8 to +50 US Standard Mesh Size) 


 [ The rate of degradation of VOCs by granular iron varies with iron suppliers and iron gradation. If site-specific treatability testing is undertaken, ETI recommends that the iron source used in the test be the same source used for the field installation, as the degradation rates determined will be specific to the iron source tested. The engineer may consider specifying the purchase of granular iron from that particular source. If a substitute product is proposed, the Contractor shall determine the degradation rates for site groundwater with an approved treatability test to determine the required flowthrough thickness of granular iron. Substitutes are subject to approval. ] 

3. Suppliers should be queried as to the buyback of reactive material, in the event excess     material exists at the end of construction. 

4. The gradation of granular iron should approximate the range specified in Table 1, and be     approved. 

 Table 1: Granular Iron and Sand Gradation Requirements 

 Sieve Size Weight Percent Passing US Standard Mesh Number mm Number 8 2.4 95 – 100 Number 16 1.2 75 – 90 Number 30 0.6 25 – 45 Number 50 0.3 0 – 10 Number 100 0.15 0 – 5 

5. Granular iron should be transported and arrive on site at near ambient temperatures. 

6. The granular iron shall not be directly exposed to moisture, mixing with foreign matter     during production, shipment or storage. 

7. The granular iron unloaded at site should be protected from contact with water at all     times. Stored granular iron should be covered with impermeable sheets anchored or tied     in place, if stored outdoors. Granular iron should not be stored directly on the ground     surface. 

8. Protective packaging should not be removed from granular iron until mixing or placement     in the PRB. Unused portions of granular iron shall be returned to storage and protected in     accordance with the above requirements. 

**Sand Materials for Reactive Mixture** 

1. The gradation of the sand shall approximate the grain size range specified in Table 1 and     be similar in minerology to the native aquifer materials, and be approved. 

2. Sand shall be free of stones, clay particles, debris, organic matter, and other foreign     material. 

3. Sand should be in as dry condition as possible prior to mixing with the granular iron. 


**Reactive Material Quality Control** 

**Granular Iron** 

1. Grain size sieve analyses are to be completed on representative samples collected a     minimum every [___] tons/kg [ _typically up to 10 tests are sufficient_ ] during the     production run in accordance with ASTM D 422, Particle Size Analysis of Soils (only the     sieve portion of the test has to be completed). The results are to be within the range     specified in Table 1. 

2. All involved parties should reserve the right to visit the Manufacturer during the     production run to visually inspect the manufacturing process and collect random samples     at that time. The Manufacturer should provide reasonable assistance to obtain these     samples. 

**Sand Material** 

1. Grain size sieve analyses are to be completed on representative samples collected a     minimum every [___] tons/kg [ _typically one to three tests are sufficient_ ] of sand delivered     to the site in accordance with ASTM D 422, Particle Size Analysis of Soils (only the sieve     portion of the test has to be completed). 

**Granular Iron/Sand Mixing [** **_If applicable_** **]** 

1. The granular iron and sand shall be mixed into a uniform mixture using suitable     equipment. Satisfactory means, incorporating weighing, or metering shall be provided to     assure the proper ratio of iron to sand is maintained. Equipment such as concrete trucks,     mobile concrete mixers (e.g. Elkin Mixer), or stationary concrete mixers (e.g. pug mills)     are suitable alternatives. [ _The most common and accurate method to mix iron and sand is_     _to pre-weigh sand in concrete trucks and add iron to the concrete trucks when they arrive_     _on site. By using this method, the percent weight is easily determined since the weight of_     _the sand and iron is known. The iron and sand is then mixed in the concrete trucks for a_     _minimum of 10 minutes at high revolutions. Another method for mixing iron and sand is_     _using a stationary or portable mixer such as an Elkin mixer or a pug mill. The Elkin_     _mixer works in such a way that the sand and iron are added to separate open bins and the_     _flow valves are adjusted to correctly add the quantities of sand and iron required in the_     _mix. The iron and sand are then mixed with an auger on the discharge of the auger._     _Another method of mixing iron and sand would be to mix them by volume. This method_     _involves using an excavator bucket or front end loader bucket of known volume and_     _adding iron bags with a known volume to an empty concrete mixer or other similar_     _machine to achieve the proper iron and sand mixture. All iron and sand mixtures should_     _be verified using the magnetic separation test procedures (Attachment A) before the iron_     _and sand mixture is placed in the trench._ ] 

2. All equipment should be clean of foreign materials (e.g. concrete mix, soil, stones, etc.). 

3. The granular iron/sand mixture shall contain a minimum [___] percent granular iron by 

 weight dry. [ The specification should specify whether the proportion of granular iron to be used in the mixture is given as a dry weight percent or volume percent. Weight percent 


 based on trench width is preferred. This requires a determination of the expected in place bulk density of the granular iron and sand.] 

4. The iron/sand ratio shall be based on the actual bulk densities for the granular iron and for     the sand. A bulk density of 150 lbs/ft^3 (2,400 kg/m^3 ) shall be used for the granular iron     and a bulk density of 100 lbs/ft^3 (1,605 kg/m^3 ) shall be used for the sand. [ _Alternative bulk_     _densities can be proposed by the Contractor and used if approved by the owners_     _representatives._ ] 

_5. The ratio of granular iron to sand is dependent on the actual excavated width of the_     _trench (Table 2). ETI’s minimum recommended amount of iron in an iron/sand mixture is_     _20% iron by volume. The granular iron/sand ratio shall be based on dry weights. The_     _following are examples of granular iron/sand ratios for a 2 ft (0.6 m) wide trench:_

6. The weights of sand and granular iron mixed in each batch shall be measured with     approved methods and recorded. 

7. The sand and granular iron shall be mixed to provide a uniform mixture. The uniformity     of the mixture shall be determined with a magnetic granular iron separation test as     described in Attachment A. The results of the magnetic separation test must be within __     [ _2%_ ] or greater of the specified ratio. 

8. [ _If applicable_ ] If the granular iron/sand mixing is to occur off site, the mixing contractor     must be made aware of granular iron handling and storage issues (i.e. keeping it covered     and dry). The granular iron/sand mixture must be stored in a manner similar to the     granular iron. 

9. The granular iron and sand mixture may be stored prior to installation based on the     moisture content of the mixture as specified in Table 3.

 Granular Iron/Sand Mixture Maximum Recommended Storage Times (hr) 0 to 3 72 3 to 6 48 6 to 9 24 greater than 9 8 

10. During transport and handling, care should be taken to minimize vertical drop and     vibration of the finished product to prevent separation/segregation. 

11. Quality control testing of the mixed sand and granular iron materials shall be conducted     on every _____ [ _100 cubic yards; 75 m_^3 ] of material to verify compliance with the     specifications. 

**Trench Excavation** 

1. The Contractor shall provide sufficient numbers and types of excavating equipment to     complete the PRB trench to the final depth and complete the project within the schedule.     The equipment is to be in good condition with no hydraulic leaks and have been     decontaminated prior to mobilization to the site. 

2. The Contractor shall maintain the stability of the trench excavation. The Contractor shall     control surcharges from excavation and backfill equipment, soil stockpiles, backfill     stockpiles, and any other surcharge loads that may affect trench stability. 

3. The following tolerances shall apply to the PRB trench dimensions and construction. The     tolerances may vary from the designed values if approved by the Owner’s representative.     a. The PRB shall be essentially vertical.     b. The PRB shall be measured or surveyed to within _______ [ _6-inches; 15 cm_ ] of the        desired elevation.     c. The PRB trench shall follow the designed alignment within _____[ _1-foot; 30 cm_ ] of        the designated centerline.     d. [ _If applicable_ ] The PRB shall be keyed in the underlying aquitard to a minimum depth        of ____ [ _4 inches; 10 cm_ ].     e. Construction will not be permitted when severe weather conditions may compromise        the quality of the work.     f. [ _If applicable_ ] Monitoring wells shall be installed to within _______ [ _3-feet; 91 cm_ ] of        the designated location. 

4. In the event the excavated trench is wider than the design thickness (e.g. partial collapse     has occurred), the Contractor may increase the ratio of the sand to granular iron to provide     an equivalent granular iron flow-through thickness. The calculation of the granular     iron/sand ratio shall be based on the minimum measured trench width in the section of     concern. Any change must be approved and be no less than 20% by volume of granular     iron. Cost for additional supply and placement of granular iron and sand materials and     disposal of excess soil shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. 

**Backfilling of Reactive Material** 

1. The reactive material is typically placed to the historical high water table. 


2. a) If the excavated trench is filled with water, the reactive material shall be placed into the     trench via a tremie tube with a minimum diameter of 12-inches (30 cm) or other approved     method. The base of the tremie tube shall be maintained a distance of not more than 4-ft     (1.2 m) above the top of the placed mixture.     b) If the excavated trench is dry or only small amount of groundwater is present, the     backfilled can be placed by freefall, without using a tremie. 

3. The Contractor shall excavate a sufficient length of trench to accommodate the slope of     the mixture or provide means of preventing the placed mixture from reaching the     excavation face. 

4. Water from an approved source may be added to the backfill to assist in placement and/or     as a dust control measure. 

5. Samples of the granular iron/sand backfill are to be collected from the approximate mid     depth of the trench a minimum every [___] ft/m along the trench. The granular iron     fraction is to be determined using the magnetic separation test to verify compliance with     the specifications. 

 Backfilling on Top of Reactive Material 

1. After the trench has been filled with the reactive material, a geotextile may be place on top     followed by clean native soil or sand, or depending on the site conditions, perhaps a lower     conductivity material may be required. 

 Construction Quality Control 

 Granular Iron 

1. Several samples of the granular iron should be collected during the construction. The     production number (bag number) and location of placement in the PRB should be logged. 

 Sand 

1. Several samples of sand should be collected during the construction. The source of the     sand and location of placement in the PRB should be logged. 

 Granular Iron and Sand Mixture 

1. The percent granular iron on a dry weight basis is to be determined with the Magnetic     Separation Test as described in Attachment A. The testing should be completed on     representative samples collected from the mixing device. The frequency of testing will     depend on the potential variability of the mixing method. Typically more testing is     completed in the early stages of the mixing and this frequency is reduced if the results are     adequate. The percent granular iron must meet a minimum percent specified on a dry     weight basis for the project. 

2. Where the granular iron and sand is mixed in a batch process, the percent granular iron     can be determined on a bulk basis. The mass of sand is to be determined by an approved     method such as a truck scale, portable scale or bucket scale. The mass of wet sand must     be corrected for moisture content, either with the moisture content determined with the 


 magnetic separation test of a moisture content test on the sand. This provides assurance that the correct tonnage of granular iron is emplaced. 

3. The granular iron sand mixture shall not be stored for periods greater than specified in 

 Table 3. 

**Trenching and Backfilling** 

1. Where the confining unit is bedrock, the bottom of the trench shall be verified by scraping     the competent bedrock with the excavator bucket in the presence of the Site Owner’s     representative. Where the confining unit is soil, the bottom of the trench shall be verified     by visual inspection of material excavated from the confining unit. 

2. The final depth of the trench should be measured a minimum every 10 feet (3 m) along the     length of the trench. The depth shall be measured on each side and the middle of the     trench and referenced to a benchmark. 

3. The mass of granular iron emplaced in the trench shall be recorded. The mass of granular     iron emplaced shall be checked against the design mass on as short a trench section as     possible (e.g. each panel or defined section, as it is difficult to determine the volume of     backfill when a section is not completely filled). 

4. Samples of the granular iron/sand backfill are to be collected from the approximate mid     depth of the trench a minimum every [___] ft/m along the trench. The granular iron     fraction is to be determined using the magnetic separation test to verify compliance with     the specifications. 

**Health and Safety** 

1. The Contractor should ensure adequate protection for all on-site personnel and prepare     and implement a complete site-specific Health and Safety Plan in accordance with all     applicable federal, state, and local regulations. The plan should cover the Contractor,     subcontractors, and visitors while on the site. 

2. The granular iron material is a dust nuisance and adequate personal protective equipment     should be worn at all times while handling or being in close proximity to granular iron     material. MSDS data sheets are available from the manufacturer. 

3. The contractor should be made aware that mixing of granular iron and sand might cause     the temperature of the mixture to increase by several tens of degrees due to friction of the     granular particles and oxidation of the granular iron. 

**Attachment A Magnetic Separation Testing Procedure** 

[ _Note: The Contractor or Site Owner’s Representative, or both may complete this test._ ] 

1. Weigh the empty containers that the samples will be collected in. 

2. Samples (about 250 to 1,000 g) of the iron-sand mixture are collected from the     discharge of the mixing device (e.g. shoot of a concrete mixer) and/or from the     backfilled material with excavation. The frequency and location of samples is     dependent on the objectives of each project. 


3. Weigh the sample (empty container and sample) and record the weight. Determine the     net weight of the sample by subtracting the empty sample container weight. A     suitable weighing device must be used. 

4. Dry the sample. If cemented together during drying, lightly breakup, weigh and     record the net weight. 

5. Spread the sample out in a suitable container (e.g. bowl, pan, cardboard box, etc.). 

6. Cover the magnet in a material (such as a plastic bag) to allow the magnetic material     to be easily separated from the magnet. 

7. Pass the magnet over the sample to remove the magnetic fraction. Care must be taken     to minimize the trapping sand particles within the iron grains. The magnetic fraction     is removed from the magnet and placed in a container. 

8. Continue passing the magnet over the material until no more magnetic material is     removed. Mixing of the non-magnetic fraction between passes may be required to     obtain all the magnetic particles. 

9. The magnetic fraction may contain some non-magnetic (sand) particles. Repeat Steps     5 to 8 should at least three more times to ensure the magnetic and non-magnetic     fractions are completely separated. After each separation, the non-magnetic fraction     should be added to the non-magnetic fraction from the previous separation. 

10. Weight the magnetic and non-magnetic fractions are and weights recorded. The total     net weight of the magnetic and non-magnetic fractions should be the same as the     weight prior to separation. 

11. The dry iron net weight percent is determined by:

## Monitoring of Iron Permeable Reactive Barriers 

 Monitoring of a granular iron permeable reactive barrier (PRB) is typically completed by installing groundwater monitoring wells, collecting and analyzing groundwater samples from these wells. This technical note provides general guidelines for developing a monitoring well network, plan, and monitoring schedule based on site-specific objectives for groundwater remediation. There are many site-specific factors that need to be considered when developing a monitoring plan for a PRB and this technical note only provides a general guideline. Other available references or guidelines are provided by EPA (1998), Battelle (1999) and ITRC (1999). 

 Monitoring Well Network 

 Where the groundwater plume at the site is delineated and monitored over distinct depth intervals or zones, it is recommended that the PRB monitoring network follow the same pattern. The discussion in this technical note assumes only one zone hydrogeological unit and would be repeated for each significant hydrogeological unit 

 Continuous PRB 

 Transects of monitoring wells should be placed along the groundwater flow path, upgradient, within and downgradient of the PRB. The number of transects depend on site-specific objectives but transects are typically placed approximately every 100 ft (30 m) along the alignment or a minimum of three transects across the PRB. The upgradient well should be placed about 5 to 10 ft (1.5 to 3 m) upgradient and the downgradient well about 5 to 10 ft (1.5 to 3 m) downgradient. For hanging PRBs (not keyed into a confining unit), wells may be placed below the PRB on the upgradient or downgradient side to monitor for plume by-pass beneath the PRB. 

 If possible one or more monitoring wells should be placed within the PRB either during installation or after. The flow-through thickness of the PRB may dictate how many wells can physically be placed in the PRB. If only one well is placed in the PRB in each transect, this well should be placed as close to the downgradient side of the PRB as possible, typically about 6-inches (15 cm) from the downgradient side in excavation based construction. Wells placed in the upgradient portion of the PRB are useful for monitoring the long-term performance of the PRB as they will provide an early warning if conditions (e.g. permeability, reactivity) are changing within the PRB and allow time for corrective measures to be completed if required. 

 Tel: 519.746.2204 Fax: 519.746.2209 Web page: http://www.eti.ca 


Monitoring wells are placed at each end of the PRB to monitor for plume capture. If possible, these side gradient wells should be installed and sampled prior to PRB construction, to confirm they are indeed clean prior to PRB installation. 

**Funnel and Gate** 

Transects of monitoring wells should be placed along the groundwater flow path, upgradient, within and downgradient of the gate. Typically, only one transect per gate is installed unless the gate is relatively long (e.g. more than 50 ft; 15 m). The upgradient well should be placed about 5 to 10 ft (1.5 to 3 m) upgradient and the downgradient of the gate well about 5 to 10 ft (1.5 to 3 m) downgradient. 

One or more monitoring wells should be placed within the gate. The flow-through thickness of the gate may dictate how many wells can physically be placed in the gate. If only one well is placed in the gate in each transect, this well should be placed close to the downgradient side of the PRB, typically about 6-inches (15 cm) from the downgradient side. Wells placed in the upgradient portion of the gate are useful for monitoring the long-term performance of the gate as they will provide an early warning if conditions (e.g. permeability, reactivity) are changing within the gate and allow time for corrective measured to be completed if required. 

Monitoring wells are placed on the upgradient and downgradient side of each funnel section to monitor the head differential across the funnel sections. Monitoring wells are also placed at each end of the funnel and gate system to monitor for plume capture. 

**Installation of Monitoring Wells** 

Monitoring wells outside of the PRB can be installed with conventional techniques. 

Wells within the PRB can be placed during construction with certain PRB construction techniques. If wells are installed during backfilling, care must be taken to ensure that the wells are not displaced as backfilling proceeds. For example, potential problems may occur if the well gets pushed against the wall of the excavation. Samples collected from the well will not be representative of groundwater in the PRB. Stiffer well materials (e.g. heavier schedule PVC or stainless steel) or frames may be required to maintain the position of the wells during backfilling. Typically, the wells are 2-inches (5 cm) in diameter. 

Wells can be placed within the PRB after backfilling using conventional drilling techniques. It is important to know with relative certainty that the well screens are within the iron and have not been placed against or within the adjacent aquifer material. This typically is more of a concern for deeper well installations. In other words, measuring the plumbness (verticality) of the well is critical. A few degrees of deviation from vertical can result in several inches of horizontal deviation of the well screen at depth. If reactive material is displaced during well installation (e.g. hollow-stem augering) than the well annulus should be backfilled with the reactive mixture. 


**Groundwater Sample Collection and Analysis Plan** 

Sampling of wells close to or within the PRB requires special considerations in order to obtain representative samples. Purging and sampling large volumes of groundwater may result in groundwater from outside the PRB (i.e. the aquifer) being collected resulting in a non-representative sample. There are no set guidelines on the amount or rate at which groundwater should be purged or sampled. This must be determined on a case-by-case basis considering the thickness of the PRB, location of wells, groundwater flow velocity, and well configuration. Typically low flow sampling procedures have been utilized. Recently at some sites, diffusive bag samplers (Vroblesky and Hyde, 1997) have been used to collect samples for VOC analysis. 

Standard sampling procedures can be used for wells installed in the aquifer upgradient and downgradient of the PRB, provided the purging and sampling will not influence groundwater flow through the PRB. 

It is important to consider the fact that most PRBs are placed across an existing plume, not at the front edge of the plume. For this reason, monitoring wells placed in the aquifer downgradient of the PRB will continue to exhibit VOC concentrations for some time following PRB installation due to the time required to flush the downgradient aquifer and desorption of VOCs from the aquifer solids with treated groundwater from the PRB. This condition must be accounted for in the development of a monitoring plan for the PRB. 

Monitoring the potential change in hydraulic performance of a PRB can be accomplished by measuring water levels in the vicinity of the PRB and by completing hydraulic testing on wells within the PRB. Water levels are used to compute hydraulic gradients, which after accounting for seasonal variations, can be used to monitor potential changes in the hydraulic conductivity of a PRB. Water levels can also be used to develop potentiometric maps to assess potential changes in flow through or adjacent to a PRB. Typically, slug tests are completed as it is the change in hydraulic conductivity over time that is typically of interest. 

We note that coring and analysis of core material is not usually completed as part of a routine monitoring program. 

If the PRB is to be located near a surface water body, it may be prudent to map any groundwater discharge points (seeps) and associated staining prior to PRB construction. These data may be useful to refute any subsequent perception of PRB effluent (i.e., iron in the effluent groundwater) causing staining at the point of discharge. 

Table 1, lists the recommended parameters, monitoring frequency, and monitoring location for a groundwater monitoring program. This table is meant to be a guide and should be modified to suit site-specific needs.
