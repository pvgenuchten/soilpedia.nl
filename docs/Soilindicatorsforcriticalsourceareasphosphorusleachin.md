### Abstract 

An excess of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus (P) in surface waters can cause eutrophication. Since points sources (e.g. sewage treatments plants, fertilizer industries) in general succeed in reducing their output, difise sources of P like agricultural fields become more important. Within agricultural areas differences may exist in the contribution of different fields to the total loading of e.g. P to surface water. Areas that have a high contribution are called Critical Sources Areas (CSA). Factors that are important for CSA’s in surface runoff are relatively wel1 known: the main factors are tendency to produce runoff (slope) and soluble P in the top soil, related to plant available P. Both factors are relatively sirnple to deterrnine in practise. An important condition for such a CSA is a hydrological link between a field and an adjacent surface water, so the field has to border the surface water or must have a link via (artificial) drains. 

Detecting CSA’s for P transport through the subsoil to surface water is investigated less intensively. One reason for this is that, until recently , it was believed that leaching of P hardly occurs since soils have a high P binding capacity. However, the insight is now gaining that the sorption capacity for P of almost al1 soils is limited, and that some factors may accelerate P transport through the soil profíle. Examples of these factors are preferential flow and fast transport of organically or particle bound P. 

 This report deals with an evaluation of indicators that can be used in the field for detecting CSA’s for subsurface P loss, also denoted as leaching. The study was performed by literature research, by analysing existing data sets and by an inquiry among partners in the European COST network on contribution of agriculture to eutrophication with P. Parameters that are mentioned or used as indicator for CSA’s via leaching are: 

- P content in the soil solution; 

- soil P content (total P, plant available or water-extractable P); 

- P saturation index; 

(^) soil hydrological characteristics, leading to a high risk of preferential flow ; 

- P content of tile drainage water; 

- P content of the bottom sediment, or of the surface water adjacent to the field*     An important condition for a usefúl indicator is that it has a limited temporal variability.     Otherwise, the time of determinin g the indicator would influence the result too much. 

 P content of Uze SO~Z&Z&VZ gives a direct indication of the downward moving solution through the soïl profíle. However, sarnpling of this solution is a time consuming process, and the conditions of samplîng, storage and tirther treatment have a large influence on the results. Due to the complex@ of obtaining reliable data of P in the soil solution, sampling of the soil solution has so fa hardly been used as an indicator of CSA’s. As an alternative, 

### extraction of homogenized soìZ sampZes with water or a dilute salt solution has been used to 

 simulate the soil solution. 


_TotaZ top soiZ P content_ gives only a first indication of potential CSA’s. Without fúrther knowledge on the binding capacity of the subsoil this @ure is meaningless. _Plant avaiZabZe_ 

#### P content gives a comparable fust indication needing subsoil data. For CSA’s, it wil1 be an 

advantage when the method used is directed on readily soluble P compounds, since these are most mobile in SOL 

#### A satmztion Mex for a soil was originally developed for acid sandy soils, and was based on 

oxalate extractable P, Fe and Al. The relation between this index and e.g. water soluble P is reasonable, but differs for different soil types. Several ether saturation indices were proposed recently , but testing for different soil types has stil1 to be done. 

 Soil hydrological characteristics, leading to a high risk of pre$érentiaZ jlow, are most important for choosing a sampling depth. Preferential transport will cause rapid transport of P from the top soil to drains, and thus make the condition in the subsoil less relevant. In that case field samples must be taken fkom the top soil. Preferential flow occurs in cracking clay soils; dried organic soils; soils with continuous macropores, e.g. created by earthworrns, and water repellent soils. 

 Although P content of tiZe drainage water gives an indication of the direct input from a field to surface water, its usefulness for detecting CSA’s is limited. The main reason for this is the fact that tile drain P content can be very variable in time, both within hours or days in case of rain storm flow and within months due to changing seasons. Thus, sampling tirne wil1 have a too large influence on the result. 

 A high temporal variability was also found for the P content of ditch water close to agricultural fields, which make it probably nat an ideal parameter for detecting CSA’s. Resuspension of sediment during periods of high discharge rates makes the sediment a dynarnic compartrnent, with variable composition. However, data of P in ditch sedirnents are limited, and its usefulness for CSA’s cannot fúrther be evaluated yet. 

 It was concluded that water soUZe P is the most promising parameter as indicator for CSA’s. It is correlated with soil solution P content, with P content in artificial runoff, and with drainage water P in case of preferential fluw. Care must be taken that sufficient tirne is taken between sarnpling and the last application of any fertilizer. Sarnpling depth must depend on hydrological conditions. In case of a very shallow water table or preferential flow the plough layer should be sampled, otherwise samples should be taken tiom layers near the water table or artificial drainage depth. 


### Samenvatting 

Het verlies van fosfat (P) vanuit landbouwgronden kan leiden tot eutrofiëring van oppervlaktewaterGevolgen van eutrofiëring kunnen zijn: het optreden van algenbloei, het vóórkomen van toxische organismen, anaërobie van het oppervlaktewater en/of het sediment, en een verminderde aantrekkelijkheid voor recreatie. In het algemeen wordt het verlies van P gedomineerd door runoff en erosie. In sommige streken, zoals Florida (USA), West-Australië en Nederland, wordt P vooral via ondiep grondwater getransporteerd naar het oppervlaktewater. In de regel bepaalt de transportweg de omvang van het jaarlijkse verlies: bij erosie kan het jaarlijkse verlies meer dan 20 kg P hao1bedragen, bij runoff ligt het meestal tussen 1 en 5 kg ha-‘, en bij uitspoeling meestal lager dan 1 kg ha? Het feitelijke P-verlies hangt onder meer af van de belasting van de bodem met P in het verleden en van de capaciteit van de bodem om P te binden. 

 Intematiod gezien is het besef dat uitspoeling van P belangrijk kan zijn relatief nieuw. De bodem werd altijd in staat geacht om fosfaat goed vast te kunnen leggen; vrij algemeen wordt nu echter erkend dat de vastleggingscapaciteit eindig is. Op plaatsen waar lange tijd meer P is toegediend dan door het gewas wordt tigevoerd kan deze capaciteit zijn verbruikt. Bodems rijk aan organische stof, zoals veengronden, werden altijd als, een uitzondering gezien: hier vindt relatief veel uitspoeling plaats. Het onderwater zetten van een grond bevordert de uitspoeling sterk, doordat bij anaërobie ijzeroxiden in oplossing kunnen gaan waaraan P is vastgelegd. In kleigronden en droge organische gronden kan preferentieel transport door macroporiën plaatsvinden. 

 In veel studies waarin uitspoeling van P is onderzocht is het moeilijk om deze te correleren met gehalten in de bodem zelf, in de ondergrond of de bouwvoor. Dikwijls is dit het gevolg van onvolledige gegevens. Echter, de weg waarlangs het water zich door de bodem beweegt is variabel, evenals de periode waarin dit gebeurt. Een snelle afioer van percolatiewater via drainagebuizen vermindert de contacttijd met de bodem, waardoor er minder P via vastlegging aan de ondergrond kan worden verwijderd. Dit heeft tot gevolg dat het veel lastiger is om de plaatsen te voorspellen waar uitspoeling zal plaatsvinden dan in het geval van verlies via oppervlakkige afspoeling. 

 Voor veel stroomgebieden geldt dat een groot deel (meer dan 75%) van de jaarlijkse afvoer van P plaatsvindt vanuit een klein deel (tot 5%) van het totale bodemoppervlak. Dit worden ook wel criticul sowce arem (CSA ‘s of fosfmtlekkende gronden) genoemd* Dit kan zowel opgaan voor transport langs het bodemoppervlak als via uitspoeling. CSA’s voor oppervlakkig transport zijn uitgebreid onderzocht, en relatief goed bekend. Veel minder is bekend over CSA’s waar uitspoeling de oorzaak is van verlies van P; voor Nederland geldt dat P verlies vanuit de bodem door uitspoeling veel belangrijker is dan

meer dan de helft van het totale jaarlijkse verlies aan P. Dit geldt met name voor het optreden van oppervlakkige afspoeling van P en voor het vóórkomen van preferent transport door het bodemprofiel (zie par. 4.4). Het treedt op bij een al grotendeels met water verzadigde bouwvoor, _een_ hoge regenintensiteit en een hoog gehalte aan desorbeerbaar P van de bodem. 

Meer inspanning is nodig om plaatsen op te sporen binnen een stroomgebied waar onevenredig veel uitspoeling van P plaatsvindt. Op deze plaatsen kunnen dan extra maatregelen worden genomen om uitspoeling te beperken, omdat dit een hoog milieurendement heeft. 

 In deze studie zijn indicatoren geëvalueerd die bruikbaar zouden kunnen zijn voor het aanwijzen van CSA’s voor uitspoeling van P. Dit is gedaan door middel van literatuuronderzoek en aan de hand van (ongepubliceerde) databestanden. Daarnaast zijn vragen gesteld aan Europese onderzoekers die betrokken zijn bij COST Actie 832: ‘Quantifying the agricultural contribution to eutrophication’ [with phosphorus] l 

 Bij de evaluatie was een belangrijk criterium de variatie in de tijd van de indicator. Een bruikbare indicator levert een vrij constant beeld op in de tijd, omdat anders (te) hoge eisen worden gesteld aan het tijdstip van meten. 

 Parameters die worden genoemd of gebruikt als indicator voor CSA’s via uitspoeling zijn: 

- P-gehalte in het bodemvocht; 

(^) P-gehalte van de bodem (totaal P, plant-beschikbaar of water-extraheerbaar P); 

- P-verzadigingsgraad; 

- hydrologische eigenschappen van de bodem, bepalend voor de kans op preferent     transport; 

- P-gehalte van drainwater; 

- P-gehalte van sediment, of van oppervlaktewater nabij een perceel. 

 Het Pmgehalte van het ~&wwxY+z~ is een directe indicatie voor de oplossing die zich neerwaarts door het bodemprofiel beweegt. De monstername is echter tijdrovend, en de wijze van monstemme, bewaren en verdere behandeling hebben een grote invloed op de gemeten P-gehalten. Omdat het moeilijk is om betrouwbare gegevens te verkrijgen over P in bodemvocht wordt dit gegeven zelden gebruikt als indicator voor CSA’s. Als alternatief worden gehomogeniseerde grondmonsters geëxtraheerd met water of een verdunde zoutoplossing om bodemvocht te simuleren. 

 Het fotaZgeIz&e VUIZ de bouwvoor geeft slechts een eerste indicatie van mogelijke CSA’s. Zonder kennis over de bindingscapaciteit van diepere bodemlagen heeft dit gegeven weinig betekenis. Het voor de plant beschikbare P vormt een vergelijkbare eerste indicatie, met dezelfde bepertig. Het is een voordeel wanneer voor plant-beschikbaar P slechts makkelijk oplosbare P-verbindingen worden geanalyseerd, omdat die het meest 

 iv 


mobiel zijn. Dit is bijvoorbeeld het geval met methode voor bouwland. 

De _ver&ìgingsgmzd van een_ bodem is (^) oorspronkelijk ontwikkeld voor zure het Pw-getal, de in Nederland gebruikte zandgronden, en is gebaseerd op met oxalaat extraheerbaar P, Fe en Al. Er bestaat een vrij goede relatie met bijvoorbeeld water-oplosbaar P, maar deze is afhankelijk van bodemeigenschappen zoals pH. Inmiddels zijn er verschillende verzadigingsindexen in omloop, maar deze zijn nog niet uitgebreid getest op verschillende bodemtypen. Bodemeigenschappen die leiden tot een grote kans op _prefererzt tnznsport_ zijn van belang voor de keuze van de bemonsteringsdiepte. Preferent transport zorgt voor een snel transport van bouwvoor naar drains en oppervlaktewater, en maakt kenmerken van de ondergrond van minder belang. In een dergelijk geval moet monstername in de bouwvocx gebeten. Preferent transport treedt op in: (i) kleigronden waar scheurvorming plaatsvindt, (ii) uitgedroogde organische stofrijke bodems, (iii) percelen waar ononderbroken macroporiën voorkomen, bijvoorbeeld als gevolg van activiteit van regenwormen, en (iv) waterafstotende gronden. Hoewel het P-gehalte van _dnzinwuter_ een indicatie is voor de directe uitstroom van P richting oppervlaktewater, is de bruikbaarheid voor CSA’s gering. De voomaanxte reden hiervoor is het feit dat dit gehalte sterk kan variëren in de tijd, zowel binnen uren of dagen in het geval van hevige regenval als binnen maanden door seizoensinvloeden. Het tijdstip van monstername zal dus een (te) grote invloed kunnen hebben op het resultaat.. Een grote variatie in de tijd werd ook gevonden voor het P-gehalte van _oppervkzkte~ater_ nabij landbouwpercelen, wat dit minder geschikt maakt als indicator. Het opwervelen van sediment gedurende perioden van verhoogde ahoer maakt de waterbodem tot een dynamisch compartiment_ De beschikbaarheid van gegevens van waterbodems van sloten is echter beperkt, en er kan dus geen eindoordeel gegeven worden over de brutibaarheid ervan als indicator. Geconcludeerd wordt in dit rapport dat _wateropbsbmr P_ de meest bruikbare indicator lijkt voor het vaststellen van CSA’s. De parameter is gecorreleerd met het P-gehalte van bodemvocht, met het P-gehalte van (kunstmatige) runoff, en met P in drainwater in geval van preferent transport. Er moet voor worden gezorgd dat de monstemarne voldoende lang (enkele maanden) gebeurt na de laatste toediening van meststoffen, in welke vorm dan ook. De bemonsteringsdiepte is afhankelijk van de hydrologische omstandigheden. In het geval van een hoge grondwaterstand (nabij bouwvoor) of van preferent transport dient de bouwvoor te worden bemonsterd, en anders een bodemlaag nabij de gemiddeld hoogste grondwaterstand of de drainagediepte. **V**

### 1 l Introduction 

The loss of phosphorus (P) from soils can lead to eutrophicatîon of surface waters. Consequences of eutrophication can be e.g.: the occurrence of algal blooms, the growth of toxic organisms, anoxia of the water or sediments, and decrease of attractiveness for recreation. In most regions, runoff and erosion are dominant causes of P loss fiom soils. However, in some regions of the world, e.g. Florida (US), Western Australia and the Netherlands, P is mainly transported fiom soils to surface waters by subsurface drainage (Sharpley & Rekolainen, 1997). In general, the arhounts of P lost varies between the different pathways: data reported for erosion can be in the range of a yearly loss > 20 kg P ha-‘, data for surface runoff are mostly between 1 and 5 kg P ha-‘, and for leaching < 1 kg P ha-‘. * 

 Leaching of P from soil by drainage was previously considered to be of little significante, other than in a few specific cases, such as poorly drained soils high in organic matter (Brookes et al., 1997). This belief was mainly based on the large capacity of many soils to adsorb surplus an~ounts of P, added as manure and fertilizers. The phosphorus wr@m cupucìty (PSC) of soils can indeed be very large, but is nat unlimited. Generally, the P concentration in water percolating through the soil profile is srnall, due to sorption of P by subsoil with a high PSC. Exceptions are acid organic or peaty soils, where the affínity and sorption capacity for P are low, due to the predominantly negative charged surfaces and the complexing of Al and Fe by organic mtter. Thus, P losses in drainage waters kom organic soils were noted up to 37 kg ha,’ yrg1(Duxbury & Peverly, 1978; Miller, 1979; Kuntze & Scheffer, 1979; Cogger & Duxbury, 1984). Soil management can be an important factor affecting P leaching: manuring of high moor grassland strongly increased P leaching compared to mineral fertilizer use (Bartels & Scheffer, 1987). 

 Furthermore, relatively large amoun~ of P can be lost by leaching from: 

- sandy soils with a low PSC; 

- soils which have become waterlogged; 

(^) clay type soils or dried organic soils with preferential water flow through macropores; (^) somcalled _P-mtzmted miZs,_ where the PSC is reduced by large additions of fertilizers and manure over long periods. Recent reviews (e.g. Brookes et al., 1997; Sims et al., 1998) assess the significante of P losses in drainage water by substiace flow as a contribution towards eutrophication, and the possible mechanisms involved in these losses. In much of the work reviewed it is difficult to relate P loss to concentrations of soil P, in either the plough layer or the subsoil, due to insufficient data Because of the variable pathways and period of water flow through a soil with subsurface drainage, factors controlling P concentrations in substiace waters are fa more complex than for surface runoff. Rapid removal of percolating soil water by 


mok and tile drains decreases the contact time with the subsoil and thus less P can be removed through sorption by the subsoil. The critical P concentration for triggering eutrophic effects in lakes can be as low as 0.02-0.035 mg P LW’(Brookes et al., 1997). Thus, the movement to the aquatic environment of even relatively smal1 quantities of P by subsurface drainage of soils can 

#### therefore pose a threat to surface water qualîty, as shown in several publications. 

 In many catchments, more than 75% of annual P export from soils is lost fiom only 5% of the land area, called critìca2 source areas (CSA‘s), both through surface runoff and subsurface drainage (Sharpley & Rekolainen, 1997). However, in catchments where both soil conditions and long-terzn loading with P are less variable, an opposite pattem is found. This is illustrated in figure 1, where estimations by Schoumans and Kruijne (1995) for the Schuitenbeek area in The Netherlands are compared with a hypothetical case.

Estimations for the Schuitenbeek area were made by Schuumans and Knijne (1995)._** For the Schuitenbeek area total cumulative loss was divided over fields with a comparable area1 loss (kg P ha-’ yrOl). It was shown that over 75 % from total loss originates fiom frelds with an areal loss of less than 4 kg P haW1y?, and less than 10% fiom fields with a loss above 8 kg P ha-’ yrW1.Thus, for this specific catchment there is no question of CSA’s, but P-loss is highly diffise. Figure 1 also shows a curve for a (hypothetical) catclnnent where a large part of the cun-fulative loss originates fiom fields with a high areal 10s~. In this case fields with a loss > 10 kg P ha**yr’ show to be responsible for 


_70%_ of cmulative loss. Since P loss is less diffùse in this catchment there is a better opportunity to attack total P loss, by taking measures on the fields with a high areal P 10s~. Producing a curve as shown in figure 1 can be part of a procedure to evaluate possibilities for P loss reduction in a specific catchent. 

As wil1 be fúrther discussed in par. 2.1, criteria to identiw CSA’s for P loss by surface runoff have been intensively studied, and relatively well known (Pionke et al., 1997; Lemunyon dk Gilbert, 1993; Gburek & Sharpley, 1998). Much less is known of the criteria to identify CSA’s for P loss by subsurface drainage. 

#### Fipre 2: Schematìzatìun uf usejìdness of ìndìcaturs for CSA 3. 

 A use&l ìndicator shows a diflerence between a CSA and a ‘normal jïeld which is (Ire or less) constant in tìme, as schemutized in 2a. Figwe 2b shuws a less usejùl indicator: most of the time the CSA und the kormal’ field do nat show a digerence, hut only dwing ceflain periods a large diffìrence is found. Only durìng these perìods measurements wil1 lead to detection of the CIA. Figure 2e shows an indicator which can hardly (or nat-) be used: during cetiain perìods the valse of the indicatur is lower for the CSA than for the ?W~IIUZ~~jìeld. mis would necessìtate contìnuous measurements, which in most cases wil1 be impussible due to custs. 


Analogous to critical source areas, there can be **_criticd murce tims md event~, since ene or_** a few events can contribute more than 50% of the annual P 10s~: Pionke et al. (1996) reported that about 70% of water phase P was exported from a watershed during 10% of the time defïned as storm flow. However, in this study surface runoff was the main P loss mechanism; no data are available for regions where P loss by leaching was predominant. 

 Finally Withers (1996) stated that “further work is required for identiwing high risk areas within catchments for irnplementation of specific land management control strategies where appropriate”. In this study it is attempted to evaluate indicators of CSA’s for loss of P through subsurface transport, by evaluating the literature and (unpublished) datasets. Additionally, expert views have been asked from European scientists who are involved as members of the COST Action 832: ‘Quantifying the agricultural contribution to eutrophication’ [with phosphorus] + 

 In the evaluation an important criterion wil1 be the temporal and/or spatial variability of such an indicator. The influence of temporal variation on the usefulness is schematized in figure 2. Spatial variation is equally important: a parameter that has a large spatial variability is less useful than a parameter that is more or less constant within a field.

In sucmnary, runoff and erosion CSA’s are characterized by slope induced runoff or erosion and a high content of desorbable P as time-independent factors Time-dependent factors are (i) the fact that runoff or erosion only occur when the rainfäll intens@ exceeds the infîltration capacity of the soil, and (ii) that loss of P along this pathway is greatIy enhanced by application of manure or fertilizers or the presence of animal excreta in periods of high rainfdl i n. t e n s i t y 

#### 22 l Regional approach 

 Examples of the regional assessment of areas where P leaching can be expected are available tiom several countries. 

#### In the Netherlands, much work is done sînce the mid 80’s at the Winand Staring Centre 

 (formerly Stichting voor Bodenkartering) based on the P saturation of the soil profile above the mean highest water-table (MHW). As wil1 be fû&her discussed in par. 4.3, the P satiation of a soil is based on the molar ratio between P and (Fe+Al) in an oxalate extract of a soil sample. For a regional estimation of P sorption capacity, data on Fe, Al and MHW were derived fiom a data base of representative soil profíles for soil survey mapping units (Breeuwsma et al., 1986). Data for POXare calculated from natural P content and data on anirnal production, fertilizer use and crops (Breeuwsma et al. 9 1997). Combining these data leads to soil maps giving the estirnated percentage of saturation of the sorption complex 


above the water table. From these maps regions can be derived where high P qoncentrations in the groundwater can be expected. A different approach of studying regional differences in the Netherlands was used by Neutel (1994). It was based on data of soil samples sent to a soil analytical lab for P-fertilizing advise* For 13 agricuhural areas it was calculated which percentage of the smples was classified as low, average or high with regard to P level. For the period 1990-1992 large differences were found between regions: a region with a low density of anixnal husbandry had 24 % of the samples with a high P status, and a region with a high density had 72% of the samples classified as high. For the whole country, between 1972 and 1992 the fraction of samples classifîed as low or very low reduced drastically, and the fiaction (ratier) high increased. A comparable approach was followed by Sims (1998) for the USA as a whole and for the State of Delaware. Based on fertility test results areas could be indicated where the major@ of the samples are rated ‘high’ or even ‘excessive’ in P, due to long tem fertilization or manuring. L,arge scale sampling of West European regions with a high livestock density showed that a high percentage of the soils in those regions had become saturated with phosphate to a high degree, and often down to the drain depti. This caused phosphate concentrations in drainage water above the limit for eutrophication of surface water or even above the limit for the production of drinking water. A geostatistical approach, that could identiw CSA’s at a scale of 25 ha, showed that tio*m the soils in four Belgian regions with a high livestock density 2-21% could be classified as P risk area and only 0.2.2.2% as P saturated area (VLM, 1997). However, to identi@ CSA’s for P losses with drainage water the scale of smpling should go down to the average field size of the fm involved, which at least is expensive. Until now a relationship **_between phospbm satzmtim degree_** (PSD) of the total soil profile and soil solution P concentration at the bottom of the sampled soil profile bas been used (Eireeuwsma et al., 1997; De Smet et al., 1996a,b, 1997; Schoeters et al. 9 1997; Scokart et aLY1997). Taking into account the distribution of the PSD over the soil profile h relation to drain depth could improve the identification of fields as CSA. 

 Catchent studies tiat quant@ tic phosphate loads of strearhs and rivers are complementary to the regional approach that estirnates the inputs of phosphates tiom different sources to surface water. Pionke et al. (1997) and Sharpley et al. (1995) reviewed the hydrological, landscape and chemical controls on phosphorus loss from catchnrents. They conclude that P export fkom a catchent must be exarnjned at the catchent scale, as well as at fm and field scale. First, hydrology related processes that dominate at the catchent scale can control which fm or fields contribute most to the exported P. Second, catchrnent elements between field and catchrnent outlets may alter the timing, the amount and the concentration of bioavailáble P exported. These boundary or transitory elements can include wetlands, channels and reservoirs, and may act as storage buffers or filters (Pomrnel & Dorioz, 1997; Hillbricht4lkowska et al., 1995). 


The contribution of agriculture to P discharge of seven selected Euopean catchments varied between 1% and 42%, with area runoff varying from 0.14 to 3.9 kg P hao yr-’ (Iversen et alY 1997). In general, the relationships between P concentration levels and agricultural activities in the catcbents are complicated. The P load from diffuse sources ranged between 0.10-0.45 kg P haal for subcatchments of the Odense fjord, and between 0*09-2.43 kg P hao1for subcatchInen.ts of F!iver Avon. In catchents with a high population density the P levels are dominated by the discharges fiom point sources (e.g. sewage treament plant@. A good relationship between P discharge and agricultural activity and intens@ can only be established in catchments where such inputs are small (Iversen et al.Y 1997). Since the transport of P from artificially drained catchments mainly occurs during storm events, reliable estimates of P losses can only be obtained using a sampling strategy that incorporates intensive sampling during these events (Grant et al., 1996). 

 A catchrnent study of the Poekebeek watershed, in a Belgian region with a high percentage of P saturated soils, showed the difficulty to distinguish between the contribution of diffuse arable land sources and from other sources (Hartmann et al., 1997; VLM, 1997). Mean ortho-P concentrations of strem ranged between 0.5-1.0 mg LW1 dwing wet periods and between 0.6-1.5 mg LW1b dry periods. In spite of the extra P contribution by agricultural drainage water in wet periods, P concentrations of the brook water were lowered by rainfall. Since discharge rates were higher, P export was also higher dtig wet periods. During dry periods, P from point sources accumulated in the bottom sediments within the catchment, and was mobilized during very wet periods when drainage waters tiom arable land also contributed. A combination of high P concentrations and high water discharge rates caused very large fluctuations (range 3-1060 kg) in daily P export fiom the catchment

 In The Netherlands, data on P use (feed and fertilizer) and soil fertiliv leve1 are available only on a municipal level, since the privacy of individual fmers is protected. For regional studies this is insufficient detailed. 

 In summary a regional approach has proven its validity for the identification of CSA’s for surface runoff in the USA. For a fírst identification of CSA’s in the case of P leaching a regiond approach is useful, but for defíning CSA’s on field scale the availability of data on hydrology and on the P sorption capacity or P saturation of the subsoil are necessary as well. 

 23 l Phosphorus balance at farm leve1 

 A phosphorus balance, the differente between P tiport and P export, at the fm leve1 can give a fírst irnpression of potential P losses to surface waters. Long periods of annual P surplus czwed considerable regional P enrichment of soils in Western Europe. As an illustration, average vzilues for P surplus for several European countries are summarized in Table 1.

### 3 b Results of înquiry 

 made meng participants of an European netwerk entitled: COST 832, agricultural contribution to eutrophication ‘. Information was asked about 

An inquiry was _‘Quantl@ing the_ tnerr _**_^ l^ experlence. with indicators for CSA’s. The text of the letter can be found in Appendix 2. The information received is surnrnarized below, and wil1 further be used in chapter 4. 

_Dorìoz, 27zonon-Les-B&s~ Frunce:_ Intensive studies are done on processes in watersheds Export of P during base flow and rain storm flow are compared; P is essentially exported dwing rain storm flows. A high temporal variation is found in the P concentration of the surface water leaving the watersheds studied. NO direct research was done on indicators for soil CSA’s. 

 Hudkainen, Univ. Helsinki, FinZand: In the past, most research was done on surface runoff and erosion, but recently more attention is paid to leaching. Rainwater bypassing a field is assumed to receive P, detached or desorbed from soil particles. This mechanism can be applied both on surface runoff and leaching. In general, the degree of P saturation of FelAl hydroxides is low, in Finnish soils; its determination using oxalate can be disturbed by dissolution of calcium phosphates. Water-extractable P (1:60, filtered over 0.2 Pm) is assurned to be a readily available fraction of soil P which can be used to estimate the amount carried off from a field by surface runoff (Hartikainen, 1982). In cracking clay soils indications were found of P transported fiom the plough layer into drainage pipes by preferential flow. 

 Hqgurth, North Wyke, UKA number of reprints was received on transport mechanisms of P, preferential flow and influence of artificial drainage. 

 Hens, Leuven; Hown, Gent, BeZgium: A report was received on an inventory of P saturation of sandy soils in Belgium (VLM, 1997). The saturation of the soil profne with P was used as an indicator of potential CSA’s. A regional soil sarnpling was performed following a grid, and soil maps were constructed using interpolation. The concentration of ortho-P in drainage water increased with the saturation degree of the soil profile on the same location, but showed a large temporal variation (in: Brookes et al., 1997, p. 266). 

 Leinweber, VechtdR~st~ck, Germany: Reprints were sent of publications on regional inventories of P contents and saturation in intensively fertilized parts of Gerrnany. Also, a pre-print was received of a study correlating P content of lysimeter drainage water and soil P analytical data. 


#### Sibbesen, Tjde, Denmrk: A report by Simrnelsgaard (1996) was sent entitled: Plant 

 nutrients in subsurface drainage water and soil water (in Danish). Movement of P to surface water was mainly due to surface runoff, and its amount was correlated with soil P content. A positive correlation was found between NH4-N and P in drainage water, which indicates macropore flow. 

&IWZ, ZïXch, &&e&z&: A copy was received of a PhD-thesis (Stamm, 1997). The main subject of the work is rapid transport of P in intensively managed drained grassland soils, caused by preferential flow. High P concentrations were found in tile-drain effluent, before the peak of the water flow. Afier manure application, ahnost immediately high P concentrations were found in the effluent.. 

#### Wemer, Bum, Gemny: A research report was received on soil P content and P 

 saturation, in relation to drainage and surface water. 

#### VEthem, Winchester, UK: In a Rotharnsted field experiment, the concentration of P in 

drainage water and in a CaCl2-extract was found to increase exponentially with increasing Olsen-P content ( > 60 mg kg-‘; Brookes et al., 1997). Now this relation is investigated on ether soil types; it appeared that the sharp increase in CaCl2-P differed between soil types (18400 mg kg-‘). This variation created some doubt on the direct applicability of Olsen-P as an indicator of P leachability. Nevertheless, an exponential relationship was found ietween Olsen-P and P extracted tiom suction cups. 

#### Y%HaZZa& Jamson, Jokìoìnen, FinZand:In a field experiment both plant-available P in 

the plough layer and the P content of drainage water was determined. NO significant correlation was found between both parameters. 


(^4) l **Evaluation of indicators** The following characteristics of a soil or fíeld have been used, or suggested, as indicators for CSA’s: 

- P content in the soil solution;. 

- P content of the soil (total P, plant available or water-extractable P); 

- P saturation index; 

(^) soil hydrological characteristics, leading to a high risk of preferential flow; 

- P content of tile drainage water; 

(^) P content of the bottom sediment, or of the surface water adjacent to the field* 41 l (^) Soil solution P content Dissolved P in the soil solution often represents less than 0.1% of total P in the SOL After the addition of P fertilizer or manure, increased P concentrations can be present in the soil solution for some time. Ternporary changes in soil conditions (pH, redox potential and ionic streng@ can ause mobilization of inorganic and/or organic P and thus the actual P content of the soil solution. Thomas ei lysimeters from pipe content of content in al. (1997) measured P in the soil solution, sapled with porous cups, f?om installed in a sîlty clay loarn soil. The cups were installed at 60 cm distance drains. Soil solution P content at drainage depth was much lower than P drainage water, but a close correlation was found between soil solution P the plough layer and P in drainage water. This led to the conclusion that preferential flow contributed to a large degree to P loss from the lysimeters (Thomas et al., 1997). Ritchie and Weaver (1993) state that the potential short term leaching of P can be estimated from water soluble P in the soil solution just before winter rainfall. The potential yearly loss of P, when no fertilizers are applied, can be estimated with bicarbonate-P. Except for the topsoil layer, limited data are available about actual concentrations of dissolved P in the soïl profile. When sarrrpling of the soil solution is attempted, a strict protocol should be followed, including analysis within 24 hours, to limit the risk of artefacts caused by smpling, sample preparation and storage (Chapman et al., 1997). The soil solutîon can be seen as a highly variable natural matrix containing soluble salts, colloids, and organically complexed substances. When îts total P content is deterrnined, the way of digestion can strongly influence the P content found (Rowland and Haygarth, 1997). Centrifugation of undisturbed soil cores has been used to isolate soil solution fiom the soil

The use of water-extractable P content (F%v)of a soil as an indicator for plant available P was introduced in The Netherlands by Sissingh (1971) and Van der Paauw (1971). Hartikainen (1982) postulated that water-extract&ble P is a readily available fkaction of soil P that can also be used to estimate the amount carried off fkom a field by surface runoff. For a silt~loam grassland sofl, Pote et al. (1996) found that P content of runoff water correlated better with water-extractable P, with P extracted by FeO-paper (Sissingh, 1983) and with the oxalate saturation index than with traditional soil tests (Mehlich 111, Bray 1 and Olsen). Also for grassland soils, Blennerhassett (1998) found a better correlation between P content in artificial runoff and water-extractable soil P content than with Olsen-P. However, under very dry soil conditions P in runoff increased much more than water-extractable P, which reduced the possibility to use a general applicable relationship between P in runoff and in a soil water extract. Pote et al. (1999) also showed an influence of runoff volume on the relationship between P in runoff water and waterextractable soil P. When comparing three Ultisols, a uniform relationship between both parameters could be found after correcting for differences in runoff volume (Pote et al., 1999). 

 Beauchemin (1996) found a weak correlation between P in drainage water and soil P status for 27 sites. However, when homogeneous soil classes were used, the correlation was better: a combination of Pw and [Pi/(Al+Fe)]ox gave the best result’.

 ’ [Pi]ox denotes P measured directly in an oxalate extract, without previous digestion. 


Blaauw et al. (1988) measured P content in the centrifuged soil solution and waterextractable P (PW) of smples fiom 41 soil profiles, containing 6 to 9 layers. A toti of 10 field plots were sarnpled, on clay , sand, loess, and reclaimed peat soils. Figure 4 shows the correlation between Pw and the P content of the soil solution of different soil types. Although the data are plotted on a double-log scale, it appears that Pw can be used as an indicator for soil solution P content. 

 In appendix 1 separate figures are shown for the different soil types. From these figures it appears that, when the relationship in figure 4 is used, for clay soil the P content of the soil solution is slightly over-estimated, and for reclaimed peat soils it is slightly underestimated. As also shown in appendix 1, water-extractable P increases during dry periods, probably due to breakdown of organic rnaterial. Although fluctuations with tîme were found in water-extractable P, these were not very large, implicating that Pw is a relatively stable soil parameter. 

 Gächter et al. (1996, 1998) investigated P losses from drained grassland soils in Switzerland. Concentrations of P in drainage water and in surface runoff during an exceptionally heavy rain storm were about equal, frequently exceeding 1 mg P L? This led to the conclusion that in periods of high discharge rates, soil solution from the plough layer moved to the drainage ditches via preferential flow through macropores. Gächter et al. (1998) proposed to use the water-extractable soil P content as an indicator of the P content of the soil solution of the topsoil layer, according to @ure 4. 

43 l (^) Soil P **saturatim degree (PSD)** For non-calcareous light-textured soils another approach bas been followed by Van der Zee et al. 9 (1990). A relationship was shown between the phosphate sorption saturation degree (PSD) of the soil profïle between the soil surface and the groundwater, and the dissolved reactive P (MW) concentration c (in mg La’)in the soil solution at a reference depth: PSD =yKc/(l +yKc) where: y = ratio between total fïxed P and reversibly adsorbed P K (^) = Langrnuir adsorption constant 

##### (1) 

 Assuming tit the phosphate sorption capacity (PSC) of a soil can be calculated as:

A high hydraulic conductivity can be found in macropores (> 100 PM), originating ffom e.g* soil tracks, root channels, and earthworm borings (Edwards et al-, 1993) Preferential flow through these pores only occurs when the rainfdl intens@ exceeds the infiltration capacity of the bulk soil (Simard et al., 1999). Macropores^ can be destroyed by soil tillage. In Ontario, Canada, conservation tillage, e.g* zeroor ridge tïllage, is considered the best management practice to control soil erosion fiom agriculture (Gaynor and Findlay, 1995). It was found that total P loss from fields treated witi conservation tillage was larger than on conventionally tilled fields, which was attributed to preferential flow in the forrner. Large peaks of ortho-P in tile drain water were found both with zero and ridge tillage, indicative of preferential flow (Gaynor and Findlay , 1995). Simard et al. (1999) compared P content of drainage water under fields treated with either mouldboard ploughing or with ridge tillage. The latter treatment showed a much higher amount of P in the drain water than the fermer, attributed to preferential flow through the macropore netwerk in the soil. 

 Drainage studies on a silty clay loam soil at Rothamsted showed that t0tal-P concentrations in drainage water were less than 0.3 mg LW’.However, this concentration strongly increased on fields with Olsen-P (0.5 M NaHCOj-extractable P) contents in the plough layer exceeding 60 mg kg-’ soil (Heckrath et al., 1995). In the UK, this Olsen-P content is classified as very high (Tunney et al., 1997b). The observations were in agreement with a bypass flow mechanism in the subsoil, causing soil solution from the plough layer, with elevated P concentrations, to reach the drains without much reduction in P concentration through adsorption by the large P sorption capacity of the subsoil (Thomas et al., 1997). 

 Simrnelsgaard (1996) found a positive correlation between NWN and P content of drainage water. This is an indication of macropore flow, since leaching of NWN is usually inhibited by nitrification in the top soil. 

 Jensen et al. (1998) studied P transport in undisturbed subsoil blocks in the laboratory. They compared P mobilized by either distilled water or by a dilute salt solution (stiulating rain water and soil solution, respectively). Streng indications for preferential transport of P were found in the columns; a decrease of the ionic strength of the solution lead to an increase of P transport. 

 Turtola and Jaakola (1995) found peaks of P in drainage water soon after fertilizer application on a heavy clay soil followed by a drain discharge of only 7-15 mm, which indicated preferential P movement. 

 Hooda et al. (1999) measured losses exceeding 5 kg total P haB1yr-’ from grassland soils. These amounts were fa more than earlier astemations. Subsoils did clearly not retain a significant proportion of P leaving the topsoil, despite having a large P retention capacity. This was ascribed to preferential flow, e.g. through worm-chamels. Sm et al. (1998) measured water discharge and P content at the outlet of a drainage system of permanent 


grassland in Switzerland. Concentration peaks of P in the drain water coincided with peaks in water discharge, indicaGng preferential transport through the soil profïle. Vertical worm burrows to a depth of 80 cm were the dominant structures that explained this fat transport (Gächter et al., 1998). Since population densities of deep dwelling earthworms are ofken very high in permanent grassland under Swiss environmental conditions (Daniel, 1992), it was postulated that preferential transport can be the norrnal case rather than the exception (Flury et ,al., 1994; Stamm et al., 1998). 

 In conclusion preferential flow can cause transport of soil solution kom the topsoil layers directly to tile drains or to the surface water, without sorption of P to the subsoil. It is a phenomenon that can be widespread, especially in (permanent) grassland soils or in arable soil under reduced tillage. Indications of preferential flow are: (i) a fmt response of P in drain effluent to the effluent hydrograph, and (ii) the absente of a relationship between soluble P in the subsoil and P in drain water. When preferential flow is important for transport from a given field, sampling of the topsoil wil1 give the best indicator for CSA’s. 

 45 l Tile drainage water P content 

 Spatìal variatìun Detailed measurements at drain outlets showed significant differences in P discharges between drains, that reflected differences in the PSD within the field and in drain depth, (Hartmann et al., 1997; VLM, 1997). Thus, measurements made on a single drain reflect only P losses at the sub-field level, that may not be representative for the whole field. Considerable intra-field spatial variability of PSC and PSD were also found in a transect study around a field drainage ditch (Looban et al., 1996). Meinardi and Van den Eertwegh (1997) sampled drain water on fm situated on clay soils. A fm in the Dutch province of Zeeland (Colijnsplaat) showed significant differences in drain water compsition between the northern side and the southem side of the fields. The drain water at the southem side showed higher Cl and P contents, especially during periods with Cl-contents near 200 mg L? It was concluded that this was caused by periodically occurring discharge of nutrient rich seepage water kom marine origin. Comparable results were obtained on another marine soil by IWACO (1995); see also next paragraph. 

 Tempural variatiun Pattems of P loss with drainage water have been shown to vary considerably with flow rate. A small nuuiber of storm events, or intensive rainfáll periods, are often responsible for the major part of annual P losses with drainage water. Bolton et al. (1970) found that annual P loss was positively correlated with annual drain flow rates, indicating that nutrient concentration varied less than flow rate. A large part of the temporal variation in loss rates was related to the interaction of short-term events with slurry spreading, fertilizing, or poaching of land by animals in the winter (Haygarth & Jaks, 1997; Hooda et al., 1997; Johnston et al., 1965; Lennox et al., 1997; Stamm et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1995; McAllister & Stevens, 1980). 


A regular sarnpling programrne with fixed intervals will result in sarnpling a high percentage of base flow, resulting from groundwater with a low P content. This can underestirnate P loss by more than 50% (Grant et al., 1996). Continuously monitored P losses kom a catchrnent were used to assess the errors associated with losses estimated fkom simulated discrete smpling progranxmes (Stevens & Stewart, 1981). They showed that P losses based on log-log rating curves consistently underestimated the truc losses by around 50%. Therefore, quantification of total P loss via drainage water requires that P losses at high discharge events should be accurately assessed. However, such events can be short-lived and unpredictable in their occurrence. For this purpose drainage water should be monitored continuously in a flow-proportional way (Grant et al., 1996). 

 In Belgium, tile drainage water, kom 19 fields receiving different mounts of P in the past was smpled during two winter seasons (Brookes et al., 1997). Large differences in Pcontent were found, both between fields and between individual sarxrplings. However, differences between fields were nat found during al1 samplings. Also in Belgium, VLM (1997) found a large temporal variation in P content of dram witer of a field with a high soil P level. At the start of a rainf&ll period the P content of the drainage water was equal to the soil solution on drain leve1 (0.5 mg P Lg’). Afier several weeks of rainfall, the water table between the drains raised to a leve1 near the soil surface, and lead to a streng increase in drainage water P content (1.8 mg Lg’). 

 Stanxn et al. (1998) found large variations in P content of drain water during a short timeinterval (‘hours); rninimurn and mmum concentrations differed 2-5 fold. Although a loglog relation between drain water P xontent and drainage rate was found for different drainage events, the relationship varied between events. Haygarth and Jarvis (1995) found a two-fold increase in total-P content of drainage water within 3 hours during a storm; this increase was attributed to particulate forms of P. A seasonal variation was also found: in spring the MRP concentration was twice as high as during autumn. It was very low during summer. 

 R.M.Perrot (New Zealand, persxommun.) also found a large temporal variation in the P concentration of drain water of grassland soils with drainage tiles on ca. 40 cm depth. 

 Beauchernin et al. (1998) measured total P in drain water of 27 sites in 1994 and 1995. On 24 sites P content was low (C 0.06 mg P Lol). Due to temporal variation the field with the highest P content in the drain water in 1994 had the lowest in 1995. The differente between both years could be attributed mainly to particulate P (> 0.45 Pm) in the samples. Hergert et al. (198la,b) measured P content of tile effluents fiom manured land, and found that P concentration increased and decreased with flow rate. The P content was negatively correlated with the Ca content of the drainage water. It increased sharply at Caconcentrations below 5 mg LW’. 


Chardon et al. (1997) found a streng negative correlation between Cl and P content of effluent from maize grown, outdoor lysimeters. Highest total P contents (up to 0.3 mg. LW’)were found when Cl was < 5 mg.LO’. This^ was attributed^ to preferential^ flow of (nearly) undiluted rainwater, mobilizing colloidal forms of P (Chardon et al. 9 1997). Comparable correlations (high **P,** low Cl) were found by IWACO (1995) in soil solution sarhples from suction cups on farms situated on a sandy soil and a peat soil. A fm on a marine clay soil showed the opposite: highest P and N concentrations (> 3 mg P Lol) were found when Cl exceeded 1000 mg.Lol, which was attributed to seepage of nutrient rich water of marine origin fkom the subsoil. 

 The conclusion is clearly that although the P content of drain water gives some indication of CSA’s, both a spatial and a temporal variation is found. For a given fíeld, large differences can be exist between individual drains, and peak values are alternating with much lower vzilues. A reliable comparison of P losses between fíelds would require continuous sampling of a number of drains, which is very expensive. Moreover, drain water can originate fiom a nutrient rich subsoil; in that case, treating the topsoil wil1 evidently be useless. As a consequente, drain water P content does not seem to be a useful indicator of CSA’s. 

 46 0 P content of adjacent surface water and the bottom sediment 

 After leaching to surface water P wil1 either remain in the water phase or sorb onto the sediment* High P concentration in the water or sediment can be an indication of a CSA adjacent to a ditch. 

 Adjacent sw$iace water Oranjewoud (1992) investigated P contents of the surface water and the P saturation of the soils tiom adjacent fields on 37 locations in the Dutch Province of Friesland. NO relationship could be detected between P saturation of the soils and P in either the groundwater or surface water. 

 Sallade and Sixns (1997) investigated sediments and surface water in drainage systems in Delaware (USA). The P concentrations in the water were variable, being highest in summer, and lowest in winter; in spring total P strongly increased. Possible explanations are: (i) soil erosion or re-suspension of ditch bottoms during heavy storrns, (ii) release of colloidal organic P upon decomposition of organic matter, and (iii) spring algal blooms (Sallade and Sims, 1997). Dorioz et al. (1998) investigated P storage, transport and export dynamics in a river watershed. The P content of the river water strongly depended on (present and past) weather and discharge conditions. At low discharges P concentrations were also low. P originated from point sources, and a net P accumulation occurred in biota and sediment on the riverbottom. At higher flow rates urban runoff and release of sediment P were 


added to the existing P burden by point sources. When soils were already wet before heavy rainf&.ll, both urba and (especially) soil surface runoff were large. P concentrations remained low due to dilution, but export of P was large due to the high discharges. In conclusion, due to the temporal variability of the P content, ditch water is probably nat an ideal parameter for detecting CSA’s. 

**_Bottom sediment_** Sediment P contents in agricultural drainage systems were analysed by Sallade and Sims (1997). It was found to decrease with depth. The sediment P contents, measured according to Mehlich-1 , were much higher than those of adjacent subsoils, and were comparable with values for topsoils. Since the sediments were analysed only once in this study, no indications on temporal variability was given 

 Dorioz (1996a) reported that P, settled in drainage ditches during periods of low discharge, can be resuspended and exported during periods of high discharge. Typical for the resuspension of sediment is that the peak of the (mainly particulate) P content of the water is observed before the pe& of the water discharge (Dorioz, 1996b) Thus, sampling of the water bottom in a period when most of the sediment has been removed after a stom flow would give relatively low P contents. Sampling a long period afier removal of sediment would give relatively high P contents of the sediment. In this way the P content of the bottom sediment of a ditch would be independent of the presence nearby of CSA’s. For this moment, lack of data do not allow fWther conclusions on the usefulness of sediment P for determination of CSA’s. 


### 5 0 Discussion and conclusions 

In this study critical source areas (CSA’s) in a watershed for P loss through the subsoil are defíned as areas that contribute signifkantly more than ether areas to the P loss to the surface water. After identiwing these areas, specific control or remediation strategies can be implemented in order to reduce total P loss within the watershed. In order to detect CSA’s, hydrological information is essential. A short distance fiom a field to the surface water, or the presence of artificial drainage, is a prerequisite for a field to be assigned as a CSA. 

 Total P content of the topsoil can only be used as a first indicator of a critical source areae For further interpretation, tiorrnation is needed on the (remaining) binding ctipacity, especially of the subsoil. 

 A phosphate saturation index of the soil profile was found to correlate with P loss rates. A nurnber of analytical methods have been developed for the determination of the index, but the various methods have ofien not been tested on different soil types. 

 The P content of the soil solution is a direct predictor of runoff or drain water P content. However, sarnpling is difficult, and sample treatment may have a large influence on the result. This aspect is responsible for the fact that soil solution samples are seldom used in practice on a large scale as a predictor for phosphate saturation of soils. 

 The P content of (artificial) drainage water is directly related to P loss, and could therefore be a good indicator. However, it was found that the P concentrations can drastically change on short term intervals, especially during periods of heavy rainfall. Also, a large differente was found between P contents of samples fkom individual drains* Continuous sampling of several drains is required for getting a complete picture of P 10~s fiom a field via drains. This makes it toe costly for application in a watershed when differences between areas or fields must be detected. A complicating factor with drainage water is the fact that the water can also originate fkom nutrient-rich layers below the drains. 

 Water-extractable P content (P-water) of the soil has been widely used for the prediction of P in runoff water, and shows a good correlation. It was also found that P-water in the topsoil correlates with drain water P in case of preferential flow. Compared with ether parameters the tempora1 variation is low; slightly increased values were found during dry periods only. Therefore it is concluded that water-extractable P content as a method is the most prornising for the detection of critical source areas. 


Soil sampling for the determination of J?-water should nat be done shortly after fertilization. Sampling in spring, before any application of fertilizers, would be appropriate. The sampling depth depends on the local hyclrology. If there are no indications for preferential flow, samples should be taken fkom -the subsoil, near the average highest groundwater leve1 or near artificial drains. Preferential flow can be expected in cracking clay soils, in dried organic soil, in permanent grassland where earthwortns have created deep and continuous soil pores, and in water repellent sok In this case, ‘samples should be taken from the topsoil. 

 In practice, large differences exist between methods used for the determination of P-water (e.g. use of field-moist or dried soil, soil-solution ratio, and filtration procedure), so some standardization is necessary on this point.

**Appendix 1 Water-extrachble P** 

 In the following, more information is given on the relation between water-extractable P and P in the soil solution, and on the temporal variability of Pw. 

 Figure la of this appendix shows the correlation between PW and the P content of the soil solution for loess and reclaimed peat soils, figure lb for sand and clay soils. Both figures contain the same regression line, calculated on basis of al1data. From these figures it appears that, when the relationship fiom fqure 4 of the main text is used, calculated on basis of al1 data, for clay soil the P content of the soil solution is slightly over-estimated, and for reclaimed peat soils it is slightly under-estimated.

Temporal variability of water-extractable P was tivestigated by Van der Paauw (1962) and Prurnmel (1974). Results of Van der Paauw (1962) are shown in @ure 2 of this appendix, where both waterextractible P (10: 1 water:soil, 24 hr extraction at 50 OC)and deviations of average rainfall for that location are given. It appeared that P-water increased during dry periods, and decreased during wet periods. tiel measured monthly the PW (60:1 water:soil, 24 hr incubation md 1 hr shaking, al1 at 20 ‘C) on a clay SOL Results are shown in the figure for a field that received no P and a field that received 120 kg P205 ha-’ yr-‘. Fertilization increased Pw sharply, ploughing infIuenced PW negatively. Results are shown in figure 3 of this appendti.

**Appendix 2** Text **of** inquiry on experiences **with indicators** 

Dear colleague, 

 You receive this letter since you are, or wil1 be involved in COST 832 (Quantifying the agricultural contribution to eutrophication). As a part of an ungoing study we would like to ask you some information. 

 In 1996 a Dutch survey was made of potential remedial measures for phosphorus leaking agricultural fields’ (see appendix for an abstract). At present we make an inventory of field indicators which can be used to point out P leaking fields within a watershed. The term which can be used for these fields is ‘critical source area [field]‘. In the USA much work has been done on detecting areas which significantly contribute to P losses via surface runoff (e.g. Piorike, 1997)*. However, in the Netherlands, which is a flat country, the contribution of surface runoff to P losses is assumed to be small. Therefore we are looking for indicators which can be used to identiQ fields which loose unacceptable amounts of P via subsurface transport or via (tile) drainage. An overview of possible indicators, based on our present knowledge, is given in the table below. 

 TABLE Possible indicators of P leaking fields: 

(^) _suil P cuntent (tut& P, plùnt avdzble ur water-extmctable P) in the pluugh @er, or neur the mam highest groundwater leve1 (MHGL)_ 

_- P suturutìun index uf the suil pruflle, ur uf suil samples neur the MHGL_ 

_- P cuntent in the suil sulutiun in the pluugh @er, ur near the MHGL_ 

_-_ (^) _suil hydrulugical churacteristics, leuding tu u high risk uf preferentiuljluw_ 

_- P cuntent uf tile drairuzgewater_ 

_- P cuntent uf the buttum sediment, ur uf the su@ììcewuter udjucent tu the$eld._ 

 Our questions are the following: (1) do you have any experience (both with positive and negative results) with the use of (one of) these indicators, and (II) do you know ether indicators than those mentioned in the table? Both published3 and preIw results can be used for our study. 

 The usefulness of indicators wil1 be studied in a literature survey and by ushg existing datasets. Next, a field study is planned to test the most promising indicator(s). The results of this inquiry wil1 be a part of the faal report of the study (in English), which wil1 be distributed among the respondents. Below you can find a list of colleagues who received this letter. If you cm give names and addresses of persons who can also contribute to this inventory it would be highly appreciated. 

 Sincerely yours, W.J. Chardon
