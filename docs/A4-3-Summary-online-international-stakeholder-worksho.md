# A4.3. Summary of the on-line international stakeholder workshop 

# (M2.1) 

**November 12th, 2014, 13-15 hrs (Central European Time)** 

**Target group** (as defined in the project plan) **:** Project partners and SNOWMAN community – European level. Attention paid to involvement of the golden quadrant: knowledge, regulators, business, community/society (invitees in appendix A). 

**Objectives of the workshop:** 

In this workshop, we will present the work carried out within Balance 4P at three case study sites (Rotterdam harbor in the Netherlands, Alvat-site in Belgium, Fixfabriken in Göteborg, Sweden) _to integrate urban planning and soil issues,_ and a suggested framework for how this integration can be carried out in general. We would like to have the stakeholders’ reflections on the work in the case studies as well as on the suggested framework. Next to that, we would like stakeholders to exchange with each other which problems and knowledge gaps are experienced in daily practice and which solutions there are. 

Main objectives are: 

 1) to test interim outcomes of project and identify common grounds between cases (shared problems and knowledge gaps). We want stakeholders to become ambassadors of the project results. 2) to get feedback on the work in the different cases (and possibly on the holistic approach as well), 3) for the case-holders: to exchange and learn from each other. 

**The Balance4P project** 

The overall goal of Balance4P is to deliver an approach that supports sustainable urban renewal through the development of contaminated land and underused sites (brownfields) with a strong focus **on integrating urban planning and soil issues**. In the Balance4P project we focus on the three Ps of sustainability (people planet and profit) and a fourth P, the process/project (web-site: [http://www.chalmers.se/en/projects/Pages/Balance-4P.aspx)](http://www.chalmers.se/en/projects/Pages/Balance-4P.aspx)) 

The specific project objectives are aimed at three important parts that are integrated in the suggested approach: 

- application and assessment of methods for _design of urban renewal / land redevelopment_     _strategies_ for brownfields that embrace the case-specific opportunities and challenges; 

- _sustainability assessment_ of alternative land redevelopment strategies to evaluate and compare     the ecological, economic and social impacts of land use change and remedial technologies; 

- development of _a practice_ for redevelopment of contaminated land in rules and regulations to     enable implementations.

## Results of survey 

The survey was created on “Surveymonkey” and the link was distributed via the chat and via e-mail by the end of the workshop. Ten respondents filled out the questionnaire completely or partly, of those, 4 specified that they were from the subsurface sector, and 2 from the surface sector (4 did not specify this). There were 3 respondents who specified they were from Sweden, 1 from Belgium and 2 from the Netherlands (4 did not specify this). Below, a more detailed summary of the responses is given but the overall impression is that the participants of the workshop were positive towards the holistic approach, but experienced it as rather abstract. Further, they found several of the different tools and methods presented useful. 

_Q1. Do you see a potential for using the suggested holistic planning process framework in the (re)development sector?_ Seven respondents gave “yes” as an answer, two did not respond, and 1 gave “partly” as an answer. One replied that it has a potential not only for brownfield redevelopment but also for later phases (asset management). 

_Q2. What constraints do you foresee in using the suggested framework?_ Several answers mention similar aspects such as it requires new knowledge, mentality, and practice. One replied that local rules may be a constraint, and one respondent missed concrete examples. 

_Q3. Is the suggested framework coherent with the planning practice in your country?_ Two respondents gave “yes” as an answer, but several answered “partly”. One stated that theoretically yes, but we need more people to practice the new approach. 

_Q4. What would you add to the framework to make it more applicable in planning practice?_ One respondent replied “What I have seen today in the example of Sweden: integrating the social parameters in the evaluation scheme is very interesting. That is what makes the local government tick; that's how to grab the attention of the local administration and to make them aware of how important the subsurface is.” Another replied that an “underground scan” should be added. But several respondents were could not give an answer here or stated that they were uncertain. 

_Q5. What would you leave out from the framework to make it more applicable in planning practice?_ One respondent replied “We saw that some methods of evaluating sustainability are better suited for certain parts of the planning process. The methods within the framework could come with recommendations about when and how they are most useful. I can ́t say I see that any specific part 


should be left out.” Another replied that it depends on scale and typology. However, most respondents did not give an answer here, or stated that they were uncertain. 

**Case studies** _Q6. Did the presented case studies help you to better understand the suggested holistic planning process framework?_ Several respondents replied “yes” to this question, and two “partly”. One of these stated that a stepby-step approach would be better. 

_Q7. Did you gain any valuable information from the presented case studies?_ Here, several replied yes, and stated e.g. “that it is possible to implement in one owns project, that it is applicable to different kinds of cases, and that a lot of valuable information was presented”. Some replied “partly”, one mentioned that the Alvat site was interesting and easy to follow, another that the social impact analysis was interesting and that it was nice to see that others had applied the SEES method. 

**Methods/tools** _Q8. Which of the mentioned methods and tools (e.g. Stakeholder analysis (SA), SEES, ESS-mapping and valuation, Sustainability assessments of remediation (MCA-tools), Social impact assessment (SIA)) do you believe could be applicable and beneficial in integrating subsurface aspects into the planning process?_ The following were given by respondents: The combination of them; SA + SEES + SIA; SEES + MCAtools + SIA; SA + SEES + ESS-mapping and valuation + SIA + add U-scan (underground scan); SA + SEES + Brownfield tools (BR2tool, Brownfield navigator, Brownfield Opportunity Matrix) + ESS-mapping and valuation + MCA-tools; SA.
