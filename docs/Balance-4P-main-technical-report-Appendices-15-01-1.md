### CONSTITUTIONAL 

(^) 1 Planning legislation Which types of by-laws exist outside the central legislative council(s) of the state and by whom are they adopted? Municipalities have the right to enhance the national building law with local regulations (gemeenteverordeni ng) As laws, by-laws can only be decided by the parliament in the field of planning. Land and building Decree(to regulate social housing); Decree for renewal (to prevent empty stock); Housing Act 2 Statemunicipal division Which constitutional principle(s) regulating statemunicipal relations exist and what is it called? Planning Act (Wet Ruimtelijke Ordening) State-municipal relations are regulated by municipal selfgovernment. Before 1970s, the Belgian Federal Government was the planning authority; this is now the regional governments. Brussels, Flanders and Walloon 3 what are main responsibilities of: state Main responsibilities of the state are: legislative; Structure vision infrastructure & space Main responsibilities of the state: national interests, sectorial planning. Flanders planning system operates on a subsidiarity principle. Competences are regulated in 1996 Spatial Planning Decree regional and Main responsibilities of the Provinces are: regional vision (Streekplan); check land-use plans against Streekplan; management of infrastructure; assist municipalities. Grant permits considering the middle deep layers. Water Boards are there for organising and maintaining the water system. Main responsibilities of regional authorities (the County Administration Board): Guiding and scrutinizing Municipal comprehensive plans concerning national interests and addressing appeals for detailed plans. Provincial plans are checked by the regional department; Provinces checks the municipal plans. municipal planning agencies Municipal planning departments make development plans and land-use plans (bestemmingsplan; issue local ordinances and grant building Main responsibilities of the municipal planning agencies: Comprehensive planning, legally binding detailed planning. Main responsibilities of the municipal planning agencies are making Spatial Structure Plans and Implementations plans. 


permission. also involved by subsurface user functions related to land use planning (bestemmingsplan) 4 Access to public authority matters 

 The people’s right to be informed and their right to give their voice: Are they defined as constitutional rights and what is the name for that principle? 

 Yes, Wet Openbaarheid Bestuur New plans need to be published online. 

 Yes. The constitutional rights are the Principle of free access to official documents (offentlighetsprincipe n) and the Principle of citizens’ participation in planning. 

 Yes, Flanders has a Decree Publicity of Governance. Plans need to be published. 

5 Property rights 

 Does the constitution protect property rights against public intervention and what is the constitutional principle in case of public taking?

 Yes, the constitution protects property rights against public intervention. In case of public taking the principle of expropriation for public needs against compensation is applied. 

Yes, the constitution protects property rights against public intervention. In case of public taking the principle of expropriation for public needs against compensation is applied. 6 Public rights to the use of land 

 Is there a general access to land and water and is there a specific right for it? 

 General access to land and water is not regulated. so-called 'recht van overpad' is private and historically present or not in contracts 

 According to "everyman's right" (allemansrätt) everyone has the right to cross and stay temporarily on another’s land and water areas provided his behaviour is not disruptive and he does not cause any damage. The right is guaranteed in the Constitution (Chapter 2, article 18, [Sveriges grundlagar]). It is allowed to pick mushrooms, wild berries, pinecones, wild flowers and suchlike on another person's land (regulated in Chapter 12, Section 2, Penal Code [brottsbalk 1962:700]). 

 The freedom to roam or everyman's right is the general public's right to access certain public or privately owned land for recreation and exercise. The right is sometimes called the right of public access to the wilderness or the right to roam. 


 8 Groups to be prioritized in planning 

 Is planning meant to give favour to particular groups of the population and if so, which groups are favoured? 

 Planning is meant to balance access to urban resources for all citizens 

 Planning is not meant to give favour to particular groups of the population. 

 Planning is meant to balance access to urban resources for all citizens

 for integration of sectoral aspects. 

 8 Environmental Protection 

 Is there an independent Environmental Impact Assessment Committee 

 Yes, it requires structure plans and zoning plans to consider all relevant data of environmental assessment in order to make a sound decision, advice is not binding but in case of a law suit it's advice is usually adopted by the court 

 No, EIA is done on the municipal level only for (not legally binding) comprehensive plans in consultation with the County Administration Board and sometimes neighbouring municipalities. EIA for the legally binding detailed plans is performed only if the municipality judges (behovsbedömning) that the proposed development may cause “substantial environmental impact” (betydande miljöpåverkan). 

 The project needs to hire a certified EIA expert to lead the team of experts that make the report. This certification is to ensure quality of the report and takes a procedure leaded by the Environmental Licences department and supported by different other departments. The report is assessed by the Department of EIA.

 Regional planning is only undertaken for the Stockholm and the Gothenburg regions. The Stockholm County Council (Stockholms län landsting) and the Gothenburg Regional Association of Local Authorities (Göteborgsregionens komunalförbund) are governmental bodies responsible for regional planning in the respective region. Regional plan is adopted only for the Stockholm County. In the Gothenburg Region, regional planning is carried out without formal regional plans. In other cases the County Administration Boards are regional bodies which does not have planning competence but consult and coordinate the municipalities in the planning process to secure national and public interests in the plans. 

 The territorial unit at regional level is the Province, for regional planning and intermunicipal coordination. The decentralized state authority is the Province administrative board. There are also Arrondissements.

Methods to integrate subsoil in spatial planning like the Soil Ladder Provinces and water boards are responsible for water management, the province for layer in between (aquifers) in relation to extraction permits, they also deal with contamination. The water boards maintain the regional water system, dikes, pumps and open water. The Province is also framing archaeology. 

 The concession from the Government is needed for extraction of minerals. The permits for mineral extraction are granted on the national level. The archaeological and soil remediation procedures are coordinated on the regional level by the County Administration Boards. The County Administration Boards also oversee hazardous activities, such as energy facilities, quarries and mines.E46

 The zoning plan is checked to see if the building application is meeting the requirements in that zone. There is a very strong connection. 

There is a very strong connection between building permits and the legally binding detailed plan. The latter is checked to see if the building application meets the requirements in the detailed plan. 8 subsoil management 

 Through the Zoning Plan some categories of the subsoil are touched on a municipal level. But next to water, remediation, archaeology and cables and pipes there is no active management or vision. Some municipalities are working on a Master Plan for the subsoil. 

 Only archaeological procedures integrated into a detailed planning process (early stage). The soil remediation procedures are usually carried out in the late stage of detailed planning or after approval of the detailed plan. Contaminated soil related issues are handled on both municipal and regional levels, but since the division of responsibilities is not clear in the legislation the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency is currently inquiring into this issue. There are special 


 regulations in the detailed plan defining land reserves (markreservat) for jointly owned facilities (gemensamhetsanläg gningar), easements (servitut), and utility easements (ledningsrätter). 

### PARTICIPATION 

(^) 1 The entitlement to inform and the right to get access to information (answers sorted by levels) Are there statutory requirements for informing the public and public access to information? Zoning Plans need to be available online Yes, at regional level, the statutory requirement for public access to information is firstly the constitution principle of free access to official documents (offentlighetsprincipe n), secondly the rules for regional planning in the Planning and building Act. All RUP's are available online. 2 Particular participatory instruments beyond information in the planning process Are there statutory instruments for public participation during the preparation of plans like number of hearings, meetings, etc.? Yes, plans need to be made public and a period of time that citizens can appeal to the plans. At regional level, there are no statutory instruments for public participation during the preparation of regional development programmes but regional plans require public reviews, public exhibition and comments on public opinions. 


3 The public opportunity to challenge the plan after the plan is formally adopted 

 Is there an option for an appeal in order to challenge the plan after it is formally adopted? 

 No At regional level, nobody can appeal in order to challenge the comprehensive plan after it is formally adopted, because it is not legally binding. But the residents can express dissatisfaction with the planning process initiating the local appeal procedure (kommunalbesvär) under the Local Government Act (kommunallag) of 

1991. The content of the adopted legally binding detailed plan can be contested by appeal to the County Administrative Board, whose decisions in turn can be contested to the Land and Environmental Higher Court (Mark- och miljööverdomstolen), and ultimately to the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen). 


### BUILDING PRACTICE 

(^) 1. Who initiates urban development? Municipalities used to get an assignment for building a certain amount of houses in their region form the national state. Provinces support these numbers in their structure plan, municipalities would initiate the development. Today development takes foremost place in existing urban tissue; the initiative is with the project developer, housing cooperation or selforganized citizens. There are several models of the development process depending on the ownership conditions within the development area and the role of the developer in the process. Initiative may come from the municipality because of need for housing, non-residential development or the enlargement and improvement of infrastructure provision. The initiative in changing the land use may also be taken by owners of a prospective development area. 

2. what type of process is used? There is an initiation     phase that looks into     the feasibility and     formulates a vision,     then there will be a     master plan, a urban     design plan and     design for public     space. 

 The process consists of vision formulation and detailed planning of the development area. When developer owns land, he plays an active role in a planning process. Municipality and developer may agree that land for streets and green areas are to be conveyed to municipality and that developer reserves space for services and communal facilities. 

3. what role does the government play? 

 The government changes from initiator and producer to facilitator. They bring parties together and set out tenders for cooperations to propose a development. 

 The Government through its representative at the regional level (County Administration Board) ensures protection of structures of national interests, national resources and intermunicipal issues in the planning process. Planning of high-, rail-, tramand 


 subways is in responsibility of Government under the Road Act (väglagen) of 1971 and the Railway Act (järnvägslagen) of 2004. 

4. How is knowledge integrated in the plan and design process? 

 Technical support always came from the municipality. In the new organic development it is unclear what the role of the municipality is in supporting knowledge integration. 

 Technical support comes from responsible divisions at the County Administration Boards and the municipality, as well as consulting agencies. 

5. how is subsoil inserted in the development process? 

 There is now no common practice concerning introducing subsoil into the development, this works through experts who enter late in the process. 

 Archaeological procedures integrated into a planning process. Planning of subsurface electrical installations and municipal facilities (pipelines) are integrated into the planning process. The soil remediation procedures are usually carried out in the late stage of detailed planning or after approval of the detailed plan.

# Appendix C – Overview of instruments 

### The content in this appendix is derived from Kok, Sien (2014): A Guide Through the Forest of 

### Sustainable Urban Redevelopment Instruments. Internship at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The 

### Netherlands. 

### The original aim of this study was to inform actors in the field of sustainable brownfield and urban 

### redevelopment on available methods and tools and provide directions to their use. To this end, an 

### overview was made of 91 relevant instruments recently applied in Europe, and they are described in 

### a short text and by using the following parameters: original aim, character, approach, tool/ method, 

### project phase, target group, effort, costs, application history, launch date, international applicability, 

### sustainability and incorporation of the subsurface. These parameters address some of the criteria 

### important for users in applying these instruments: universality, simplicity, multidimensionality, 

### transparency, adaptability/ flexibility, (legal) status and approach. Choosing the right instruments for 

### a specific project and applying them in the right way is not a straightforward process, especially in a 

### brownfield redevelopment: every brownfield has a different set of characteristics defining it (e.g. 

### history, environmental circumstances, location in the urban system, economic potential) and there 

### are often many different stakeholders and other aspects complicating the process. Ideally, 

### instruments applied in the redevelopment process are chosen after the priorities and characteristics 

### of the site are established and the problem is characterized carefully. Where (if at all) the focus in 

### sustainability lies and which role the subsurface can play in the redevelopment project, depends on 

### this assessment: several instruments are available addressing these topics. The need for adapting 

### indicators, weighting and topics addressed in these instruments to local circumstances, is 

### increasingly recognized in the field. Choosing the optimal instruments for a project becomes more 

### difficult if there is lacking know-how and knowledge in an organization on available instruments: the 

### overview in this study provides the potential user with ideas on available instruments. 

### Which type of instrument is applied, and which purposes they serve, differs over the project phases. 

### In the Anticipating Change phase (pre-initiative), instruments are available to prepare organizations 

### for change, predict future land use or assess climate risks. In the Initiative phase instruments are 

### used to support communication (e.g. familiarize with the area and stakeholders and determine 

### ambitions), the decision making process, and for gathering information. In the Design/ Planning 

### phase instruments are used in developing and choosing project scenarios and optimizing the final 

### design. In the Realization phase they are used in optimizing the construction process and 

### communication of the projects’ progress and in the Maintenance & Evaluation phase for evaluating 

### the efficiency or sustainability of the project. 

### The role of the subsurface in the instruments assessed in this study ranges from very generic to quite 

### specific. Especially in more recently developed instruments the subsurface gets more attention, 

### often as part of a holistic approach. Several instruments are included in the overview that have the 

### primary purpose of addressing the subsurface in spatial planning or urban (re)development: 

### informing the spatial planner on important factors, familiarizing stakeholders or spatial planners 

### with the possibilities and enabling them to create a collective vision and finding synergies between 

### the subsurface and other project targets. Compared to other instruments, subsurface-related 

### instruments have an even stronger need for adaption to local conditions: subsurface related factors 

### are very site-specific (e.g. soil type, hydrological situation, contamination). It is recommended to 

### address the subsurface early in the project by specifying a subsurface agenda for the area, including 


### local subsurface qualities, issues and urgency. Another advice for the early phases in the project 

### (Initiative) is to include stakeholders as early as possible. This facilitates gathering local information 

### and challenges, and enables engagement and goodwill under local stakeholders: not only during the 

### process but afterwards as well. Instruments facilitating workshops and stakeholder sessions are 

### available to support this. Participation can be improved by clearly defining and communicating 

### before application of the instrumentwhat will be done with the results, and making sure financial 

### means and time to deal with them are reserved. When digital instruments are used in the project 

### without complementing them with traditional, non-digital ones, it is good to note that they might 

### decrease meaningful interaction between stakeholders and with the data; also they have an internal 

### credibility which might not be justified. In general, it is best not to attach too much value to the 

### outcome of one single instrument, especially when it concerns software tools calculating or 

### assessing effects of a project or project scenario (remembering the old rule: the output is only as 

### good as the input). A good understanding of the instrument before application and a clear definition 

### of the desired outcome increases the result of applying a tool; especially when it concerns a 

### workshop with various participants. In this case, an independent facilitator might be also advisable. 

### Lastly, there is much development and change in the field of instruments and information available 

### for brownfield and urban redevelopment. Therefore the set-up of a general, EU-wide database is 

### recommended – as well as more local, national-scale databases of available instruments. This will 

### enable users to find the best instruments for their projects and increase exchange of available 

### knowledge.

# Appendix E – Fixfabriken: SCORE analysis 

### In this appendix, the results of the SCORE analysis are presented. For details, the reader is referred to 

### Garcao (2015) where all methods, assumptions and uncertainties of the analysis are presented. The 

### analysis is carried out on a Swedish case and Swedish crowns (SEK) was used as monetary unit. 

### Ten SEK is approximately 1 €. 

### Figures E.1 to E.3 presents the resulting mean score in each sustainability domain. Figure E.4 

### presents the mean sustainability score of each alternative, where it can be seen that Alternative 3 

### has the highest total sustainability score. The score is normalized and a relative measure, i.e. it is 

### related to the reference alternative, and the figure shows the mean value. 

_Figure E.1. Resulting score in the environmental domain._ 


_Figure E.2. Resulting score in the socio-cultural domain._ 

_Figure E.3. Resulting score in the economic domain._ 


_Figure E.4. The resulting sustainability score of the alternatives._ 

### The uncertainty intervals of the sustainability scores are shown in Figure E.5. The uncertainty 

### intervals are very wide, informing that the uncertainties are high in the analysis. Figure E.6 shows the 

### probability for each alternative of having the highest sustainability score as a way of translating what 

### the large uncertainty intervals means. For example, Alternative 3 has the highest score with a 

### probability of approximately 48%, whereas Alternative 4 only has 2% probability of having the 

### highest score. Alternative 1 has 0%, but Alternative 2 and 5, have 21% and 24% respectively. 


_Figure E.5. The uncertainty intervals of the sustainability scores._ 

_Figure E.6. The probabilities for each alternative of having the highest sustainability score._ 

### The uncertainty analysis in SCORE allows the user to investigate which criteria have the highest 

### impact on the uncertainty of the result. Figure E.7 shows an example for Alternative 1, where the 

### increased property value has the largest contribution to the uncertainty of the sustainability score of 


### Alternative 1. For all alternatives the increased property value is the item contributing most to the 

### uncertainty in the sustainability score, indicating that the uncertainty is very high in this item. 

_Figure E.7. Sensitivity analysis for Alternative 1. The uncertainty of the increased property value is the item contributing most to the uncertainty of the sustainability score in Alternative 1._ 

### The economic analysis in SCORE is a cost-benefit analysis (CBA), and it is also necessary to check 

### distributional effects of the costs and benefits in the CBA. Figure X.8 shows the costs and Figure E.9 

### shows the benefits, and how they are distributed with regard to different groups: the public (PUB), 

### employees (EMP), developer (DEV) and others. Here it can be seen that Alternative 3 is the only 

### alternative which does not incur higher costs than benefits for the public with regard to the 

### monetized items in the CBA. 


_Figure E.8. The present costs of the CBA and how they are distributed with regard to different groups: the public (PUB), employees (EMP), developer (DEV) and others._ 

_Figure E.9. The present benefits of the CBA and how they are distributed with regard to different groups: the public (PUB), employees (EMP), developer (DEV) and others._ 


### Figure E.10 shows the complete table of the CBA, indicating which items were monetized and which 

### were not. An X indicates that the item is important but not monetized, and an (X) indicates a 

### somewhat important item which is not monetized. As can be seen in Figure E.10, several items are 

### not monetized and could potentially affect the outcome of the CBA and thus also the full SCORE 

### analysis. Several of these items are costs and benefits for the public, thus also affecting the 

### distributional analysis. 

_Figure E.10. Complete list of items in the CBA. An X indicates that the item is important but not monetized, and an (X) indicates a somewhat important item which is not monetized. The numbers indicates the expected present value (not the mean present value)._ 

### Finally, the user specifies weights of the domains and the criteria in SCORE, and the results sheet 

### produces graphs of these weights, see Figures E.11 – E.13. The economic domain does not use 

### weights, as all items are measured in the same unit (SEK).

# Appendix F – Mapping of ecosystem services 

### Mapping of ecosystem services, or ecosystem services analysis, has been applied on the Fixfabriken 

### case study in Göteborg as one of three methods for evaluating sustainability in remediation projects. 

### The objective of the analysis has been to investigate the potential of this method in adding useful 

### information to the sustainability appraisal of identified remediation alternatives and future land use. 

## Method 

### The method applied follows the principles outlined in a guidance for implementation of the Water 

### Framework Directive (200060/EC) and the Floods Directive (2007/60/EC); Development for 

### Integration of Ecosystem Service Assessment into WFD and FD Implementation. (COWI 2014) ; 

### 1. Identification of relevant ecosystem services and their status on the remediation site given 

### present land use (baseline). 

### 2. Quantification of changes in quality and quantity of ecosystem services affected in the identified 

### remediation alternatives. 

### 3. Valuation of the welfare effects from the identified changes. 

### The third step of the methodology, Valuation , has not been applied in the Fixfabriken application. 

### The analysis was delimited to a semi qualitative/quantitative comparison between the baseline 

### scenario (business as usual) and the resulting changes in the provision of ecosystem services in five 

### different remediation/future land use scenarios, see Garção (2014) for a detailed description of the 

### alternatives. 

### The steps described above is also in accordance with the 6-step approach to ecosystem services 

### analysis put forward in a World Resource Institute guidance document; Weaving Ecosystem Services 

### into Impact Assessment (WRI 2013). 

### Identification 

### The process starts with identification of relevant ecosystem services. The Fixfabriken application 

### takes its point of departure in an inventory of existing ecosystem services with regard to two 

### typologies: 

### i) Urban Ecosystem Services (Baggethun et al., 2013), Table F.1, and 

### ii) Soil Ecosystem Services (Finvers, 2008), Table F.2 


_Table F.1. Urban ecosystem services as presented by Baggethun et al. (2013)_ 

**Ecosystem service Urban context** 

 Provisioning^ Food^ Vegetables produced by urban allotments and peri-urban areas. 

 Fresh water Ecosystems provide cities with fresh water for drinking and other human uses and by securing storage and controlled release of water flows. Vegetation cover and forests in the city catchment influences the quantity of available water. 

 Regulation & Maintenace 

 Air quality regulation Vegetation in urban systems can improve air quality by removing pollutants from the atmosphere, including ozone (O 3), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter less than 10 μm (PM10). 

 Climate regulation global Carbon sequestration and storage by biomass of urban shrubs and threes. 

 Climate regulation local (urban climate) 

 Water areas buffer temperature extremes by absorbing heat in summertime and by releasing it in wintertime trees. Urban vegetation provide shade, create humidity and block wind, water from the plants absorbs heat as it evaporates, thus cooling the air in the process. 

 Water regulation Soil and vegetation percolate water during heavy and/or prolonged precipitation events. Vegetation reduces surface runoff following precipitation events by intercepting water through the leaves and stems. The underlying soil also reduces infiltration rates by acting as a sponge by storing water in the pore spaces until it percolates as through-flow and base-flow. 

 Noise reduction Urban soil and plants can attenuate noise pollution through absorption, deviation, reflection, and refraction of sound. In row plantings of trees, sound waves are reflected and refracted, dispersing the sound energy through the branches and trees. 

 Water purification and waste treatment 

 Wetlands and other aquatic systems, for example, filter wastes from human activities; this process reduces the level of nutrients and pollution in urban wastewater. Likewise, plant communities in urban soils can play an important role in the decomposition of many labile and recalcitrant litter types. 

 Pollination and seed dispersal 

 Urban ecosystems provide habitat for birds, insect and pollinators. Pollination, pest regulation and seed dispersal are important processes in the functional diversity of urban ecosystems and can play a critical role in their long term durability. 

 Maintaining nursery populations and habitats 

 Urban systems can play a significant role as refuge for many species of birds, amphibians, bees, and butterflies 

 Natural hazard regulation Storm, flood and wave buffering by vegetation buffers, wetland areas; heat absorption during heat waves. 

 Cultural 

 Knowledge systems Allotment gardening as preservation of socio-ecological knowledge. 

 Aesthetic values Urban parks, sea view, urban scenic view in sight from houses. 

 Cultural heritage values E.g Neolithic settlement

### The baseline 

### The baseline scenario is compiled from information on relevant ecosystem services at the site and 

### qualitative assessments of their present supply of services. The identification is preferably based on 

### as many sources of information as possible, including e.g. maps (GIS, photos etc.), monitoring data, 

### personal visits to the site, interviews with experts with knowledge about local conditions, etc. In the 

### Fixfabriken case, aerial images complemented with information on future land use, geological and 

### archaeological investigations on the site, as well as planned remediation actions, are used to make 

### qualitative assessments of the present supply of relevant ESS for the baseline, and changes due to 

### remediation and future land use, see example in Figure F.1. 


_Figure F.1. Aerial image of the Fixfabriken area. The image reveals information on both the present and future land use as well as planned remediation actions._ 

### Once identified, the ecosystem services at the site are given qualitative scores (Table F.3) reflecting 

### their status in the present day land use (baseline scenario) at the site. 

_Table F.3. Qualitative scores used to describe the status of ecosystem services in the baseline scenario._ 

**Score Explanation** 

 -1 Present land use not only hinders the supply of the ESS but is also affecting its local potential negatively 0 Present land use hinders the supply of ESS 1 Present land use has a severely negative effect on the supply of ESS but allows for some supply of ESS 2 Present land has a somewhat negative effect on the supply of ESS 3 Present land use is not affecting the supply of ESS negatively 

### The score -1 is used in situations where the present land use not only inhibits the supply of the ESS 

### but also have an active counteracting effect due to ongoing or historical activities. One example is 

### given by the soil ESS Fresh water in the Bus garage and Fixfabriken areas on the remediation site, see 

### Table F.7 below. The hardened surfaces themselves prevent the supply of the ESS in an area where 

### the potential is very high due the geological conditions at the site. This situation would by itself 

### render the score 0 to the supply of the ESS. But the soil under the hardened surfaces is in this case 

### also heavily polluted which implies that the adsorption of pollutants into soil aggregates, and 

### degradation (chemically alteration) by soil biota is diminished. The latter condition renders the score 

### -1 to the present status of the ESS at the two parts of the remediation site. 


### The score 0 is used in situation when the supply of the ESS is hindered by the present land use. One 

### example is found in the ESS Food ; for obvious reasons there are no vegetables produced in urban 

### allotments in the Bus garage area due to the ongoing land use. 

### The score 1 is used in situations where the supply of the ESS exists but is impaired by the present 

### land use, e.g.; there is some vegetation along the Karl Johansgatan Boulevard (trees and bushes) with 

### a positive noise reducing effect in relation to the road passing just north of the area. This effect could 

### be enhanced if the present land use, in terms of buildings, roads, infrastructure etc. allowed for more 

### vegetation. 

### The score 2 is used in situations where the supply of the ESS is somewhat negatively affected by the 

### present land use, e.g. fields of lawn and vegetation are found in the areas surrounding the future 

### remediation sites. These areas have positive effects on the ESS Air purification and Local climate. The 

### supply of these ESS is however impaired by buildings and roads which implies that the full potential is 

### not achieved. 

### The score 3 is used in situations when the ESS can be considered to be unaffected by the present 

### land use. An example is given by the high cultural values represented by the Neolithic remaining 

### south of the Fixfabriken factory area. 

### The remediation scenarios 

### The changes in provision of ESS resulting from different remediation/land use alternatives are 

### assessed qualitatively/quantitatively by use of information on excavation of soil, on site/off-site 

### remediation actions, transports and future land use. In order to facilitate comparisons of the supply 

### of ESS between the baseline and remediation scenario, the same scores previously used to illustrate 

### the ESS-status in the baseline scenario are again used to illustrate the expected ESS status at the site 

### in each of the remediation scenarios. 

### Quantification 

### The quantification step implies continued analysis of the identified ESS by, 

### 1. identification of suitable indicators to describe changes in relation to the baseline, and 

### 2. identification of sources of information and/or data with regards to the indicators. 

### The indicators that have been identified for the urban and soil ESS (Table F.4 and F.5) have been 

### collected from literature (Finvers, 2008 and Baggethun et al. 2013) or from ongoing projects. In cases 

### where no information have been found, indicators have been suggested based on the features of the 

### ecosystem services they are designed to describe, e.g. the indicator for the ESS Pollination and seed 

### dispersal was chosen to be Area of vegetation (ha) which is motivated by its function as habitat for 

### birds and insects providing the mechanism for the service. 

### The indicators serve as physical interpretations, or proxies, of the impacts on ecosystem services that 

### can be expected from the remediation process itself and the future land use at the site. The 

### indicators may also be used to perform monetary assessments of the changes in provision of 

### ecosystem services that follows from remediation projects, this has not been done in this study.

## Results Fixfabriken 

### Identification and present state assessment of relevant ESS (Baseline) 

### After analyzing the sources of information regarding the physical conditions and present land use at 

### the site (e.g. aerial images of the Fixfabriken site, project information on planned future land use, 

### geological surveys and archaeological surveys), a number of urban and soil ESS where selected as 

### relevant for the Fixfabriken area, Table F.6 and F.7. The present state of each ESS is assessed using 

### the scores described above. 

### The present land use with large areas of hardened surfaces and factory buildings implies low status in 

### many urban and soil ESS in the baseline scenario. The Adjacent area just south of, but within the 

### remediation site, is however given higher scores due to vegetation with positive effects on air quality 

### and noise reduction , and geological conditions suitable for infiltration of ground water, water 

### purification etc. Parts of the Adjacent area also contains the remains of a Neolithic settlement which 

### implies cultural heritage values, the settlement also protrudes under the Fixfabriken part of the site.

### Quantification of effects from remediation scenario compared to baseline 

### In order to evaluate the effects on urban and soil ESS from the remediation actions and the planned 

### future land use at the site, the changes in indicators chosen to represent the identified ESS are 


### quantified. The results are presented in Tables F.8 through 27. In addition to the different parts of 

### the actual remediation site, some concern is also given to “areas off-site” (AOS). This is of particular 

### importance when polluted soil from the remediation site is transported off-site for deposition on 

### landfills or further treatment. The potentially negative effects on local ecosystem services at disposal 

### sites need to be considered in order to for the analysis to be complete. 

### In the final step, scores are appointed to the estimated changes in supply of ecosystem services in 

### the different remediation alternatives based on the estimated changes in quantified indicators. 

### Alternative 1(A1) 

### This remediation alternative is described in detail in section 6.3.3 of the main technical report. 

### Details concerning the quantified changes in the indicators representing soil and urban ecosystem 

### services are described in Tables F.8 and F.9 below, the consequent scores appointed to changes in 

### soil and urban ecosystem services area presented in Table F.10 and F.11.

### Effects on urban ecosystem services (4(B)) 

### Alternative 4(B) implies excavation in all four areas of the remediation site. Since no on-site

### that leads to the largest amounts of polluted soil being deposited at off-site landfills. This is reflected

### Effects on soil ecosystem services (4(B)) 

### Since excavation without on-site remediation of polluted soil is planned in all four areas within the 

### remediation site, potentially large negative effects can be anticipated in off-site landfills after 

### deposition. This is reflected in negative scores at AOS for the ESS Fresh water and Water purification 

### and waste treatment.

## Summary 

### The result from the summary of the analysis (Table F.28) shows that 2(A2) appears to be the most 

### desirable remediation alternative from an ecosystem services perspective. This alternative is 

### identical in terms of remediation actions and future land use to alternative 1(A1) with the exception 

### of a green space which is planned in the south part of the Fixfabriken area. The creation of the green 

### space has a strong impact on the final score due to its strengthening of the provision of both urban 

### and soil ecosystem services while the corresponding negative effects in the adjacent area foreseen in 

### alternative 1(A1) are avoided. Alternative 1(A1) is ranked as the fourth most attractive option in the 

### analysis. 

### The second best alternative is represented by 3(A3) which is the alternative that involves the least 

### deposition of polluted soil at off-site landfills. In addition, this alternative imposes no negative impact 

### on the adjacent area or on cultural heritage values on the site. The only potentially negative impact 


### in comparison to the baseline is attributed to the deposition of polluted soil from the 

### Karljohansgatan Boulevard area on off-site landfills. 

### The third best score is attributed to alternative 5(C). This alternative makes the most use of existing 

### buildings and structures leaving both the Fixfabriken and the tram hall intact. It does however imply 

### excavation and deposition of polluted soil from both the bus garage and Karl Johansgatan areas 

### which renders negative scores from potentially negative effects at off-site landfills. 

### The two least attractive alternatives are 4(B) and 1(A1) which is mainly explained by two common 

### features; both alternatives implies excavation and deposition of polluted soil with potentially 

### negative effects on ecosystem services at off-site landfills, both alternatives also implies negative 

### effects on the adjacent area just south of the Fixfabriken as a part of the existing green space is 

### claimed by the planned land use.

### A major part of the negative effects are expected in the alternatives were polluted soil is excavated 

### and removed from the remediation site to be deposited at off-site landfills. Whether or not these 

### negative effects will materialize depends on the conditions at the landfill sites prior to the deposition. 

### If the landfills have been previously used for similar purposes, then the new addition of polluted soil 

### will not result in additional local negative effect on the supply of ecosystem services. If a new site is 

### required for the deposits, or if the soil in question has a higher degree of pollution compared to the 

### existing soils at the landfill site, then the negative effects might be of relevance for the analysis. 

### Another important part of both positive and negative impacts come from changes in the so called 

### a djacent area. The remediation alternatives 1(A1) and 4(B) implies that some 0,5 ha of this area will 

### be claimed by the new land use causing negative effects on several ecosystem services, e.g. Air 

### quality regulation, Climate regulation local (urban climate) and Noise reduction. In addition, the 

### future land use also implies excavation of parts of a Neolithic settlement in the development area. 

### The excavation is expected to have a negative impact on the ESS Cultural heritage values , this 

### however depends on whether or not the excavation is preceded by an archaeological investigation 

### that may turn the negative effect into a positive one by means of e.g. exhibitions of the findings. 

### Discussion and sensitivity reflections 

### It is clear from the analysis that local conditions at landfill sites might play an important role for the 

### final result in the Fixfabriken case study. Assume for example that no additional negative effects on 

### ecosystem services would occur in landfill sites used for deposition of polluted soil from the 

### remediation site. The summation in Table F.28 would then turn out as below (Table F.29) after 

### removal of negative effects on the ESSs Recreation and ecotourism and Water purification and waste 

### treatment.

### The rank between the different options remains the same after removing the potentially negative 

### effects on landfill sites. The most attractive alternative 2(A2) appears even more favorable while the 


### differences between the rest of the alternatives decreases, leaving 5(C) only marginally better than 

### 1(A1). 

### The latter result indicates that the final ranking in Table F.28 is sensitive to the representation of the 

### negative effects on off-site landfills. Due to lack of information, a uniform score of -1 was applied to 

### describe all negative effects from deposition of polluted soils at off-site landfills. In order to increase 

### the precision in the analysis, a differentiated approach could be applied where variability in terms of 

### negative effects (e.g. level of pollution of the soil from different parts of the remediation site, 

### amounts of those soils, impact at individual landfill sites) are reflected in the score. 

### This analysis indicates that a qualitative/quantitative approach to map the changes in provision of 

### ecosystem services that will follow from different remediation alternatives will potentially add 

### important decision support regarding the social desirability of available options. The principal 

### strength of the method is its ability to map and quantify changes in wellbeing normally not included 

### in traditional cost-benefit analysis of remediation projects. Further, quantitative information about 

### the indicators, chosen to represent changes in the supply of ecosystem services, is crucial for the last 

### step in the analysis; monetization of the benefits from different remediation alternatives, or benefits 

### foregone. 

### Valuation of welfare effects was not performed in this analysis. Monetary valuation of changes in 

### supply of different ecosystem services does however add economic information to the traditional 

### financial assessment of costs and benefits accruing to different development or remediation options. 

### This results in a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of all the changes in wellbeing 

### brought about by specific remediation options. In cases where monetary valuation is not possible, or 

### suitable, the result of the analysis can be used together with traditional financial assessment of costs 

### and benefits in multi criteria analysis (MCA) allowing for both qualitative and quantitative 

### (monetized) data in the assessment. 

### The ecosystem services mapping have a few drawbacks that need to be considered, these are 

### discussed in the caveats section below. 

## Caveats 

### The result from the analysis can be used to give an indication on changes in the provision of 

### ecosystem services that can be expected from different remediation strategies. Summing the scores 

### of effects on different ecosystem services poses however a number of problems that need to be 

### considered 

- The effect from changes in the provision of different ecosystem services might differ greatly in 

### importance but still have the same qualitative score in the analysis. There is for example 

### probably a great difference between the negative effect on wellbeing from increased noise 

### from traffic that might be expected from the removal of a tree line in the adjacent area, 

### compared to the negative effect on wellbeing that might occur at a disposal site used for 

### depositing 26 000 m 3 of polluted soil. A way to deal with this would be to assign weights to the 

### scores used to describe changes in the provision of ecosystem services in a way that would 

### reflect their relative importance at the local scale. 


- Summing the effects on all affected ecosystem services at individual parts of the remediation 

### site will inherently hide details regarding changes that might be of great local importance. This 

### problem will to some extent be remedied by the use of weights as discussed above to highlight 

### the relative importance of different changes in the supply of ecosystem services. This must 

### nevertheless be kept in mind when the resulting scores are evaluated. 

- Knowledge about the local conditions in areas affected by remediation actions is of great 

### importance, not only at the actual site but also at off-site landfills. The negative effect from 

### disposal of polluted soil at a landfill is determined by the initial conditions at the landfill site as 

### well as the degree of pollution (and amount) of the soil being deposited.

# Appendix G – Fixfabriken: Social impact analysis 

### The social impact analysis tool (SIA) was developed as a tool to be used in urban planning in 

### Göteborg. It is typically used as an inventory tool to check what there is, what is needed and the 

### anticipated impacts of the detailed plan. In the Balance 4P project, the SIA was used as a tool to 

### investigate the social impacts with regard to each alternative. The SIA tool is displayed in the form of 

### a matrix, which takes four different social aspects into consideration: Cohesive city, Interactions, 

### Everyday life and Identity, see y-axis in Figure G.1. Those aspects are in line with the political 

### objectives of the City of Göteborg and are analysed with regard to five different scales: Buildings and 

### places, Neighbourhood, District, City, and Region, see x-axis in Figure G.1. 

_Figure G.1. The SIA tool matrix._ 

### Focus in Balance 4P has been on Neighbourhood and District, since the conceptual redevelopment 

### strategies are not detailed enough to provide information for an analysis on the scale of Buildings 

### and places. The matrix was used to: 1) map the reference alternative, 2) map preferred changes, and 

### 3) map the impacts on Alternatives 1 to 5. Figures G.2 – G.8 shows all matrices. The impacts are 

### qualitatively valued on the following scale: very negative impacts: (--), negative impacts (-), no 

### impacts (0), positive impacts (+), very positive impacts (++).
